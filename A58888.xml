            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEloved in the Lord, It is now full eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years ſince that I was placed by the hand of Provid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce, as a Spirituall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor amongſt you, upon the death of Mr. <hi>Robert Stennings;</hi> three years of which time I was forced by the violence of Souldiers, to abſent my ſelf from you: theſe three years only excepted I have been constantly with you; and as the Lord hath given me much health and ſtrength of nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, ſo I have spent much of that ſtrength in my private ſtuddies, and publick imployments for you. In witneſs whereof I can yet produce diverſe volumes of Sermons, written by me and publiſhed amongſt you: but I account this needleſs, ſeeing you your ſelves can witneſſe enough, as touching this matter. I will not compare my ſelf with other Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Labourers in Gods Vineyard, for I know that they have received, ſome of them ten talents, ſome five, ſome two; yet this I may ſafely ſay, that I have not hid my Maſters one talent in a napkin, but have improved it with diligence for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his glory and truth amongſt you.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93010:3"/>
            <p> Wherefore after ſo long a time, it concerns you all to enquire how ye have profited by my Miniſtry for be ye well aſſured, that after ſo much ſpirituall husbandry as hath been uſed amongſt you, in plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſowing, planting, and wattering; the Lord will expect a plentiful crop of ſaving knowledge and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from you.</p>
            <p>For my part, I am prone to think the beſt of you, as indulgent fathers are wont to think of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I acknowledge that diverſe of your friends and allies have dyed in my time; whoſe life was precious, and whoſe death was comfortable unto me: and I hope to be better acquainted with them in the world to come, then ever I was in this world. I ac-acknowledge alſo, that there are diverſe now living amongſt you, of whom I am perſwaded ſuch things as accompany Salvation; that they do ſincerely love God and his truth, and have not received the Grace of God, nor the word of his grace in vain: and my prayer for ſuch is, That they may perſevere in grace unto the end; holding faſt the pattern of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words which they have received; and may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer themſelves to be drawn away with the error of the wicked, and ſo fal from their own ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastneſs. And I must needs acknowledge a third ſort amongst you, whom I have hitherto apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as proud contemners of the Word of God in my Miniſtery; I pray God to give them Repentance unto life, that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the devil, and may obtain pardon for this ſin before their death; otherwiſe I tremble to think how hard it wil be with them in the great day of the Lord Chriſt, when they ſhall be accountable for every good Sermon, and for every wholeſome
<pb facs="tcp:93010:3"/> truth, which they have thus contemned and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led under their feet.</p>
            <p>And now my beloved, being deſirous before my death to leave among you ſome token and teſtimonie of my love towards you, I have publiſhed this Treatiſe, which I call <hi>A Diſcovery of the VVorld to come;</hi> ſome matters herein contained have been delivered in the open Congregation, and here your eyes may ſee what your eares have heard; yea here your eyes may ſee more, then yet your eares have heard from me, or from any other as I ſuppoſe, touching this ſubject. I am perſwaded in my conſcience of the truth of ſuch grounds as are here delivered; and my own ſoul hath felt the comfort of them, for which cauſe I am the more hopefull that the ſame grounds may proove uſefull and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall unto others. You may perceive with your eyes, that I have not ſtuddied strong lines and lofty expreſſions in this work, but have endeavoured in plain and familiar termes to unfold a great Myſtery unto you. I do not herein perſwade you to ſeek and ſearch after the knowledge of this preſent world, and the things hereof; neither do I herein perſwade you to love this preſent world, and the things hereof, you are by nature prone enough unto theſe things: but hereby I do perſwade and intreate you to study the knowledge of the world to come, and to be better acquainted with the Doctrine hereof then yet you are: becauſe I apprehend this as a choyce part and high degree of ſaving knowledge; and that which will profit you more at the laſt, then all earthly treaſures whatſoever, and I am perſwaded it is for want of this part of ſaving knowledge, that many errours in theſe latter times, are ſo readily
<pb facs="tcp:93010:4"/> entertained an aſſented unto.</p>
            <p>In brief, you have here a price put into your hands, by Gods providence; the Lord give you hearts to make a good uſe of it: and if at any time I ſhall perceive this first part of my Diſcovery to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and uſeful to the Church of God; I ſhal forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with (if the Lord ſhal permit) ſtuddy to conceive a Second Part; and as ſoon as I ſhall have conceived it, I ſhall be in travel to bring it forth to publick view. In the interim I commend you to God and the Word of Grace which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance amongst all them that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</p>

               <p>Wherefore it ſhould not be thought preſumption for me being a Miniſter of the Goſpel (though the least of many) to diſcover in this Tractate, ſuch as it is, my thoughts concerning <hi>the World to Come;</hi> In as much as the world to come is a ſubject of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent worth and excellencie, far ſurpaſſing al that can be thought or ſpoken concerning this polluted world.

               <p>Now in this Treatiſe I intend to take the Sacred Scripture for my guide, and to ſay no more herein then I ſhall conceive to be warranted thereby.

               <head>SECT. II. <hi>Shewing, That the World to come, conſidered as a Continent, is to be diſtinguiſhed from the third Heaven.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Acknowledg that there ſhall be ſome of the ſame things in the World to come, which are now in the third Heaven: As the humane nature of Chriſt, the perſon of <hi>Enoch,</hi> the perſon of <hi>Elijah,</hi> which are now in the third Heaven, and ſhall be in the World to come; and as the two latter perſons do now raign with Chriſt in the third Heaven, ſo they ſhall raign with him in the World to come: and as they now enjoy abundance of holineſs, righteouſneſs, love, joy and peace, &amp;c. ſo they ſhall enjoy as much, if not much more, in the World to come.</p>
               <p>Yet I affirm, That the World to come, conſidered as a Continent, is to be diſtinguiſhed from the third Heaven. For 1. Our Saviour Chriſt once came from the third Heaven into this world, for to take our nature upon him, but he came not then from the World to come into this world for to take our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him. 2. After his Reſurrection he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the third Heaven, but he did not aſcend into the World to come, which had then no being. 3. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> by his life time was caught up into the third Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2, 4. but we cannot ſay, he was taken up, or caught up, into the World to come. 4. The Souls of the faithful, after their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93010:9"/> from the body (as we conceive) are in the third Heaven, but we cannot ſay, they are in the world to come. 5. The third Heaven both is for the preſent, and hath been of old; but the world to come neither is for the preſent, nor hath been of old, but is altogether yet to come. From all which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes I infer, That the world to come, conſidered as a Continent, is to be diſtinguiſhed from the third Heaven.</p>
               <p>Yea that I may not diſſemble, my whole meaning is this point, I muſt needs add this above all, That I conceive as much difference betwixt the world to come, and the third Heaven, as betwixt a created and <note place="margin">Ens crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatum.</note> an uncreated Subſtance: And as I ſhall prove in its proper place, That the world to come ſhall be creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God himſelf; ſo in this place I dare affirm, That the third Heaven was never created; and if this ſhall appear to be ſo, then there muſt needs be a vaſt difference betwixt the world to come, and the third Heaven.</p>
               <p>But ſome one it may be will ſay unto me, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> you ſhould ſay, the third Heaven was never created, ſurely this will ſeem as a paradox to many, and unleſs you can ſubſtantially prove it, there are few that will believe it.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid I have ſaid, and I hope I ſhall clearly evidence this laſt paſſage, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> third Heaven was never created, by theſe enſuing Arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I take this for a ground, That which was <note place="margin">1 <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note> not made with hands was never created: which propoſition (as I ſuppoſe) none will deny: For what is it to be created, but to be made with hands? and what is it to be uncreated, but to be not made
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93010:9"/> with hands? And the Scripture acknowledgeth, that all created things were made with hands, and were the work of Gods hands; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Heavens, the work of thy fingers, the Moon and the Stars which thou haſt ordained.</hi> Verſ. 6. <hi>Thou haſt made him to have dominion over the works of tby hands.</hi> Pſal. 19. 1. <hi>The Firmament ſheweth his handy work.</hi> Pſal. 102. 25. <hi>Of old haſt thou laid the Foundation of the Earth, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are the work of thy hands.</hi> Iſai. 48. 13. <hi>My hand hath laid the Foundation of the Earth, and my right hand hath ſpanned the Heavens.</hi> Thus all created Subſtances were made with hands, and conſequently that which was not made with hands, was uncreated.</p>
               <p>Now we read of the third Heaven, that it was not made with hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 11. and that when Chriſt entered into it, he <hi>entered into the holy Places not made with hands,</hi> Heb. 9. 24. Where the Apoſtle <note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> plainly diſtinguiſheth the third Heaven not only from the Tabernacle in <hi>Moſes</hi> time, which was made with mens hands, but alſo from the whole created world, which was made with Gods hands: not denying the whole Creation to be the work of his hands, but ſaith of the third Heaven, That it was not made with hands, and if it were not made with hands, then ſurely it was uncreated.</p>
               <p>Agreeable hereunto is that other place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>If our earthly houſe of this tabernacle be diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens:</hi> Where the Apoſtle ſhews, that the Souls of the faithful after their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the body ſhall have <hi>an houſe not made</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>with hands;</hi> plainly diſtinguiſhing the Souls heavenly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93010:10"/> houſe from its bodily or earthly houſe: And as he denies not its bodily houſe to be made with hands, nor could have denyed it; becauſe God made it of the <hi>duſt of the ground,</hi> Gen. 2. So he affirms, that its heavenly houſe was not made with hands; and if it were not made with hands, then it was uncreated; and if it were uncreated, then it muſt needs follow that the third Heaven alſo was uncreated.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I take this for a ground, That which <note place="margin">2 <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note> was from everlaſting; and without beginning, was never created: which Propoſition (as I ſuppoſe) will not be denyed, becauſe it is acknowledged on all ſides, That whatſoever had a beginning, and was not from everlaſting, was created, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. and whatſoever had not a beginning, but was from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, was not created.</p>
               <p>Now I aſſume, That the higheſt Heaven (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the third Heaven) was from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and without beginning; and I am moved to think ſo, for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. God himſelf was from everlaſting, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning, as it is written, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 2. <hi>Before the Mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadſt formed the Earth, and the World, even from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to everlaſting thou art God.</hi> And we read in Scripture of <hi>Gods Glory before the world was,</hi> Joh. 17. 5. Of his <hi>Ordination before the world was,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 7. Of his <hi>chuſing of men before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 4. And of his <hi>purpoſe before the world began,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9. From which places I infer, That God himſelf was from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and without beginning; and if he were from everlaſting, then he was ſomewhere from everlaſting; I dare not ſay, he was no where from everlaſting,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93010:10"/> neither dare I ſay, he was everywhere from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but he was ſomewhere from everlaſting: and where was that, but in the higheſt Heaven? and if he were in the higheſt Heaven from everlaſting, then this Heaven was alſo from everlaſting with God, and ſo without beginning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This third Heaven is called Gods Place, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. 21. <hi>The Lord cometh out of his Place to puniſh the inhabitants of the Earth:</hi> and <hi>Mica.</hi> 1. 3. Yea it is called his <hi>high and holy place,</hi> Iſai. 57. 15. and his <hi>dwelling place,</hi> 1 King. 8. 30. <hi>Hear thou in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thy dwelling place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I demand, whether it was not Gods dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place before the Creation, as it hath been ſince? Yes doubtleſs, it hath been his dwelling place ever ſince the Creation, and ſhall be ſo for ever, and was ſo from everlaſting; for which cauſe he is ſaid to <hi>inhabite eternity,</hi> Iſai. 57. 15. and to inhabite eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is to inhabite an eternal place; for in the ſame Text, his dwelling in an eternal place, is diſtinguiſhed from his dwelling in the hearts of humble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ones. And if the third Heaven was Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal place, then ſurely it was from everlaſting with him, and ſo without beginning: Yea if we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg God to be an everlaſting Being, I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould deny him an everlaſting place ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Being.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Heaven, of which I ſpeak, is called Gods Throne, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66. 1. <hi>Heaven is my Throne;</hi> and <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 22. <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 49. And was it not his Throne from everlaſting? Doubtleſs it was; and ſo much I gather from that of the Prophet, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 93. 2. where he ſaith thus to God, <hi>Thy Throne is eſtabliſhed of old, thou art from everlaſting:</hi> which ſounds in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93010:11"/> my ears as if he had ſaid, As God was from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo was his heavenly Throne; and if it were from everlaſting, then it was without beginning; and if we acknowledg him to be an everlaſting King, and to have a Kingdom from everlaſting, as the Scripture witneſſeth in many places, why ſhould we not alſo acknowledg this his heavenly Throne to be from everlaſting, and ſo to be without beginning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yea this Heaven, of which I ſpeak, is that which is predicable, and may be predicated of the Eſſence of God, and we may ſay without a trope or figure, this Heaven is God, and God is this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for which cauſe I conceive it is, that this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is often put for God himſelf in the written Word, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 26. where it was ſaid to <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar, Thy Kingdom ſhall be ſure unto thee, after thou ſhalt have known that the Heavens do rule:</hi> which is all one as if it had been ſaid, After thou ſhalt have known that the moſt high God ſhall raign in the Kingdoms of men, as it is interpreted for us, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 21. So alſo it is ſaid unto the chief Prieſts and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 25. <hi>The Baptiſm of</hi> John, <hi>whence was it? from Heaven or of men?</hi> as if it had been ſaid, Was it from God, or from men only? So again, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 21. the Prodigal ſaid unto his father, <hi>I have ſinned againſt Heaven and againſt thee:</hi> which is all one as if he had ſaid, I have ſinned againſt God and againſt thee. And ſo laſtly <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>A man can receive nothing except it be given him from Heaven;</hi> that is, except it be given him from God, from whom every good and perfect gift doth come. In all which, and other ſuch like places, God is deſcribed by the name of Heaven, and called Heaven; and why ſo? For to teach us (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93010:11"/> that this Heaven is ſomething appertaining to the Eſſence of God, and doth not eſſentially differ from God himſelf; but as he is a ſpiritual Being, an independent Being, ſo he is alſo an heavenly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And as we may ſafely ſay, That he is a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God, the God of Mercy, and Mercy it ſelf; ſo it is not improper to ſay, He is a heavenly God, the God of Heaven, and Heaven it ſelf. Now we know that all things belonging to the Eſſence of God, were from everlaſting with him; but this Heaven, of which I ſpeak, is ſomething belonging or apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to his Eſſence, as I have ſhewed; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it was without beginning. Theſe are four Reaſons which hath induced me to think, that the third Heaven was from everlaſting, and without beginning; and if ſo, then it will from hence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, that it was never created.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I take this for a ground, That which is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu∣ment. </seg>3</label> holy &amp; undefiled, was never created: which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition may wel be granted, becauſe it is certain, that there is no eſſential holineſs to be found in any creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Subſtance or Being; for if there were any holines in <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, it was not eſſential to him, but it was the gift of God: ſo that holineſs which was and is in the humane nature of Chriſt, is not eſſential to his Humanity, but is the gift of God; and that holineſs which is in the Regenerate, is not eſſential to them, but is the gift of God; that holineſs which belongs to the ſeventh day, is not eſſential to it, but accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, by reaſon of Gods Inſtitution; that Ceremonial holineſs which was in Temples and Altars, was not eſſential, but accidental, by reaſon of Gods Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and the created Heavens are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſſentially holy, that they have been and are pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93010:12"/> and defiled with the ſin of Angels and men, as it is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 15. 15. <hi>The Heavens are not clean in his ſight:</hi> Yea the whole Creation is ſo far from being eſſentially holy, that it groans to be delivered from that bondage of corruption which the ſin of men and devils hath brought upon it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 21. 22. And if there be no eſſential holineſs to be found in any created Being, then it muſt be granted, That whatſoever is eſſentially holy and undefiled, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver created.</p>
               <p>Now I affirm, That the third Heaven is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally holy and undefiled, as we may conceive, for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Heaven was from everlaſting with God, as hath been before ſhewed; and whatſoever was from everlaſting, was eſſentially holy and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Heaven is ſomewhat appertaining to the Eſſence of God, as hath been before ſhewed; and whatſoever appertains to the Eſſence of God, is eſſentially holy and undefiled.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scripture ſpeaks much of the holineſs of this third Heaven, ſaying, <hi>He will hear him from his holy Heaven,</hi> Pſal. 20. 6. <hi>Who ſhall dwell in thy holy Hill?</hi> Pſal. 15. 1. <hi>Who ſhall ſtand in his holy Place?</hi> Pſal. 24. 3. <hi>God ſitteth upon the Throne of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> Pſal. 47. 8. which holineſs of the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven muſt be either eſſential or accidental; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental it cannot be, becauſe in thoſe and ſuch like places the third Heaven is thereby diſtinguiſhed from all places and perſons that are accidentally holy, as the diſtinction is plainly expreſſed in thoſe words, <hi>I dwell in the high and holy Place; with him alſo that is of an humble and contrite ſpirit,</hi> Iſa. 57. 15.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:93010:12"/> 4. Neither can it be proved, that this Heaven, of which I ſpeak, ever was or ever ſhall be defiled with any ſin, as the created Heavens were and are defiled. For which Cauſes I conceive the third Heaven to be eſſentially holy and undefiled; and if ſo, then from hence it will neceſſarily follow, That it was never created.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I take this for another ground, That <note place="margin">4 <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note> which is by nature immutable and unchangeable, was never created: and this Propoſition alſo may wel be yeelded, becauſe we have known the mutability of all created things. As we have ſeen the mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Angels, in that ſome of them kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. and in that others of them are now confirmed in their original purity: So we have ſeen the mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Adam</hi> in his firſt Fall, and of his Poſterity ſince his Fall: and we read of the mutability of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth which God created in the beginning; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 26. <hi>They ſhall periſh, yea, all of them ſhall wax old like a garment; as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed.</hi> And ſeeing we cannot be ignorant of the mutability of all created things, we may well grant, That whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is by nature immutable and unchangeable, was never created.</p>
               <p>But I add hereunto, That the third Heaven is by nature immutable; as we may well conceive: Firſt, Becauſe God himſelf is by nature immutable, according as it is written, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 27. <hi>But thou art the ſame.</hi> Job 23. 13. <hi>But he is ſtill of one mind; and who can turn him?</hi> Mal. 3. 6. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not.</hi> Jam. 1. 17. <hi>With him is no variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor ſhadow of turning.</hi> And if God himſelf
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93010:13"/> be by nature unchangeable, then all things belonging to his Eſſence, muſt needs be ſo too; but the third Heaven is ſomething belonging to his Eſſence, as hath been ſhewed; therefore it muſt needs be by nature unchangeable. Secondly, That which ever was, is, and ſhall be Gods dwelling place, and Gods Throne, muſt needs be by nature immutable; but the third Heaven ever was, is, and ſhall be his dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place and his Throne, as was before in part inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, therefore it muſt needs be by nature immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and if ſo, it will neceſſarily follow, That it was never created.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I take this for another ground, That which <note place="margin">5 <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note> both is, and ever hath been above the created Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, was never created; as we may well think, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot name any created Subſtance that both is, and ever was above the created Heavens: Indeed I grant, That the humane nature of Chriſt, and the Souls of the faithful ſince their ſeparation, are now as created Beings above the created Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; yet we cannot ſay, they have ever been ſo, becauſe there was a time when they were beneath the created Heavens; neither can it be ſaid of any created Subſtance, That it both is, and ever hath been above the created Heavens; wherefore we may well aſſent to this Propoſition, That whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever both is and ever hath been above the created Heavens, was never created. But I add, That the third Heaven both is and ever hath been above the created Heavens: And ſo much I gather from ſuch paſſages in the Word of God, as ſpeak of a place above the created Heavens; as, <hi>Thou haſt ſet thy Glory above the Heavens,</hi> Pſal. 8. 1. <hi>Be thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, O God, above the Heavens,</hi> Pſal. 57. 5. <hi>Thy</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93010:13"/> 
                  <hi>Mercy is great above the Heavens,</hi> Pſal. 108. 4. <hi>Chriſt aſcended up far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 10. that is, above all created Heavens, &amp;c. And if there be a place above the created Heavens, what ſhould that place be but the third Heaven? And if we acknowledg con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God himſelf, That he is, and ever hath been; above the created Heavens, as we may well acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, becauſe he is ſaid to be moſt High, and to be higher then the higheſt of created Beings; why ſhould we not alſo acknowledg concerning the third Heaven, which is Gods eſſential Place or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi,</hi> that it both is, and ever hath been, above the created Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens? and if ſo, then it will neceſſarily follow, That it was never created.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, I take this for another ground, That <note place="margin">6 <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note> which is a place of perfect Bliſs, was never created: which I conceive to be true, becauſe there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Bliſs to be found in this created World; and we uſe to ſay, None are perfectly bleſſed while they remain in this World, but are ſubject to many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and imperfections: their knowledg cannot be perfect, becauſe it is mixt with ignorance; their joy cannot be perfect, becauſe it is mixt with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; their love cannot be perfect, becauſe it is mixt with hatred; their righteouſneſs cannot be perfect, becauſe it is mixt with ſin: Yea this whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo far from being a place of perfect Bliſs, that it groans to be diſſolved, and ſo to be reſolved into a more bleſſed condition; and if there be no perfect Bliſs to be found in this created world, then it muſt needs be found in an uncreated place.</p>
               <p>But, ſay I, The third Heaven is a place of perfect Bliſs; for there the Father is perfectly bleſſed above
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93010:14"/> all degrees of compariſon or comprehenſion; there the Son is perfectly bleſſed in his degree, and there the Saints are perfectly bleſſed in their degree; and it is commonly ſaid, That this Heaven is a bleſſed <note place="margin">Coelum beatorum.</note> Heaven, the Heaven of bleſſed Ones, and of bleſſed Souls departed; and if ſo, then it will follow, That it was never created.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, I take this for my laſt ground, That <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu∣ment. </seg>7</label> which never was any thing of, or belonging to this created world, was never created: which Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we may well aſſent unto, becauſe all created Beings either were, or are of, or belonging to this created world.</p>
               <p>And I add, That the third Heaven never was any thing of, or belonging to this created world, as may appear by ſuch places of Scripture, as do diſtinguiſh this Heaven from this created world, and from all things of, or belonging thereunto.</p>
               <p>Thus the Fathers being in this Heaven, is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from his being in this created world: <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 6. 9. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs me before men, him will I confeſs before my Father which is in Heaven: Whoſoever ſhall deny me before men, him alſo will I deny before my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 10. 32, 33.</p>
               <p>Thus Chriſts being in Heaven, as touching his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, is diſtinguiſhed from his being in this created world: <hi>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the World:</hi> Again, <hi>I leave the World, and go to the Father,</hi> Joh. 16. 28. <hi>This ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into Heaven, ſhall ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus the being of holy Angels in this Heaven, is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93010:14"/> diſtinguiſhed from their being in this created world at other times: <hi>In Heaven their Angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 18. 10. <hi>Likewiſe joy ſhall be in Heaven in the preſence of the Angels of God,</hi> Luk. 15. 7, 10.</p>
               <p>And thus the being of faithful Souls in this Heaven is diſtinguiſhed from their former being in this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted world: <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 43. <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which diſtinguiſhing places I gather, That this third Heaven never was any thing of, or belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this created world; and if ſo, then it will follow from hence, That it was never created.</p>
               <p>And I would here demand of any indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not prepoſſeſſed with prejudice, Whether our Saviour Chriſt, and the faithful Souls departed, at the time of their aſcention into this Heaven, did not leave this created world altogether, and ſo go unto the Father? If you ſay, They did not, then you grant, that they yet remain in ſome part of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted world, and that at the time of their aſcention, they went but from one part of this created world unto another; and conſequently from one place of miſery unto another: But if you ſay, They left this created world altogether when they aſcended into this Heaven, then by conſequence you grant, That they are now in an uncreated Heaven; and ſo you do conſent unto all that I have ſaid concerning this matter.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I hope theſe ſeven Arguments, before produced, will ſuffice for proof of my former aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Howbeit to make the matter yet more plain, I ſhall be contented to anſwer ſuch Objections as I can imagine will be raiſed againſt the ſaid aſſertion.</p>

               <p>1. My former Aſſertion is not to be tryed by the rules of natural Philoſophy, but by the written <label type="milestone">

Now I acknowledg, That the Heaven of Heavens, in the former ſence conſidered, is a created Heaven, according to that of <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 6. and being the higheſt of created Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, it muſt needs be it ſelf alſo a created Heaven. But it will not follow from hence, That the third Heaven is a created Heaven, becauſe this is above all created Heavens, and therefore muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, as hath been ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>And for the better avoyding of ſtrife about words, I acknowledg alſo, That the third Heaven, in a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſence, may be called the Heaven of Heavens, <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of its tranſcendent excellency; as God ſometimes is called, <hi>God of Gods, Lord of Lords, and King of Kings;</hi> yet I do not remember that it is any where ſo called in Scripture; but if it be any where ſo called, it cannot be the ſame with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

                  <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. ſhould ſeem to be that; but that third Heaven may be thought to be a created Heaven, becauſe it is called the third, in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to two created Heavens, <hi>viz.</hi> the Airy Heaven and the Starry Heaven; and if theſe two be created Heavens, then the third alſo muſt needs be ſo too.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of this Objection is denyed: for we read of two <hi>Adams</hi> in Scripture, the firſt <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Adam</hi> and the ſecond; and the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was ſinful, yet it will not follow from thence, that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was ſo too. So, though I grant the two Heavens, before mentioned, to be created Heavens, yet it will not follow from hence, that the third is ſo too: And as I acknowledg that third Heaven, into which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was taken up, to be that bleſſed Heaven of which I ſpeak in my former Aſſertion; ſo I have proved by ſeven Arguments already, That it was never created; and I am the more confirmed in it, becauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls that third Heaven by the name of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and ſaith, he <hi>heard unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able words in it, not lawful to be uttered,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 4. whereas if a man could ſee and hear all that is to be ſeen and heard in the created Heavens, I ſuppoſe it might be lawful for him to utter it.</p>
               <p>Peradventure another will ſay, That which is, and <label type="milestone">

               <p>Firſt, I acknowledg, that the third Heaven is, for the preſent, the habitation of ſome created Beings; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> yet it will not follow from thence, that it is a created place: for we read, that God himſelf is, and ever hath been, the habitation and dwelling place of the faithful in all generations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 1. yet we may not thence infer, that God is a created Being: So though I grant, That the third Heaven is the habitation of ſome created Beings for the preſent, yet we may not hence infer, That it is a created place. Secondly, Whereas the Objection ſaith, That the third Heaven ſhall ever be the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of created Beings, as now it is; this is plainly denyed by me: for I believe, That the third Heaven ſhall be the habitation of Chriſts humane Nature, of holy Angels, and faithful Souls, as now it is, only for a time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. that is, until the Father ſhall have put all things under his feet, and ſhall have ſubduedall his enemies, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 110. 1. and until the times of reſtitution of all things, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. and when this time ſhall be expired (which ſhall be at the end of this preſent world) I believe, That Chriſt in his humane Nature ſhall come again from the third Heaven, with all his holy Angels and Saints with him, for to judg and raign for ever after in the World to come; and that he ſhall then deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. What Kingdom? That perſonal Kingdom of the Father in which he now raigneth, and ſhall raign till then; and that then the Father ſhall be All in All in his own perſonal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as he was before Chriſt came thither, and ſhall be ſupream over all elſewhere, (though the Son be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93010:17"/> after a ſort now equal with him,) and ſo ſhall Chriſt ever after ſit upon his own perſonal Throne, and raign in his own perſonal Kingdom, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 29, 30. as I ſhall have occaſion hereafter in this Treatiſe to ſhew more fully.</p>
               <p>Now what other matters will be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my former Aſſertion, I cannot imagine: but the former Objections are thus anſwered; and I ſuppoſe that other ſuch like may as eaſily be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

               <p>The ſecond thing which proves this preſent world to be evil is pain or puniſhment, whereof alſo there is much to be found; and as long as a man lives in this world, <hi>his fleſh upon him ſhall have pain, and his ſoul within him ſhall mourn,</hi> Job 14. 22. Sin and puniſhment are as the cauſe and the effect, as the mother and the daughter, the one leads the way, the other drags after; the one makes men merry for the preſent, the other makes them mourn afterward: and as all men living have ſinned, ſo they do all ſuffer for their ſin more or leſs, in one kind or other; only with this difference; thoſe pains which are ſuffered by Gods Elect in this world, are truly ſaid to be caſtigatory, and ſuch as do prepare them for eternal Salvation; but thoſe which are ſuffered by the reſt,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93010:20"/> are truly ſaid to be vindicatory, and ſuch as do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for eternal wrath: And the pains of this life are either inward, ſuch as are inflicted upon the Soul, or inward man; or elſe outward, ſuch as are inflicted upon the body, or outward eſtate of man. But if any deſire to have a particular accompt of the pains of this life, he muſt hear and obſerve the ſeveral plaints and cries of all particular perſons, and ſo you ſhall have one to cry out, Oh my head! another, Oh my eye! another, Oh my tooth! another, Oh my heart! another, Oh my back! another, Oh my bones! another, Oh my bowels! another, Oh my thigh! another, Oh my foot! You ſhall have one to complain of the Fever, another of the Pluriſie, another of the Dropſie, another of the Palſie, another of the Stone, another of the Strangury, another of the Gout. You ſhall hear one bewail his corporal blindneſs, another his deafneſs, another his lameneſs, another his poverty, another his oppreſſion, another his loſſes, another his impriſonment, another his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment: And perchance you ſhall have another ſay, The graves are ready for me, and the pains of death, or the pains of Hell are upon me: <hi>Thus luſt when it hath conceived, bringeth forth ſin; and ſin, when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death,</hi> Jam. 1. 15. Yea, not only man himſelf doth thus ſuffer for his ſin in this world, but alſo other creatures do ſuffer pain for mans ſake; and the whole Creation is in pain, and groans to be delivered from that bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which the ſin of man hath brought upon it; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Now all pain or puniſhment is evil in its own nature, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 13. That which helps to make the days of our pilgrimage to be few and evil, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 9. And <hi>all the days of the afflicted are evil,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:93010:20"/> Prov. 15. 15. And conſequently this preſent world, that hath ſo much pain or puniſhment in it, muſt needs be evil in this reſpect. And if here it ſhould be asked, Whether the latter days of this world ſhall not be better then the former, and more free from pain and puniſhment? My Anſwer ſhould be, I think they ſhall not, becauſe our Savior hath foretold us of many painful evils that ſhall happen towards the end of this world, as of Wars, and rumours of <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 6, 7, 10, 30.</note> Wars; of Famines, Peſtilences and Earthquakes in divers places; of the riſing of Nation againſt Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Kingdom againſt Kingdom; of the riſing of parents againſt their children, and children againſt their parents; of hating and betraying one another: and ſheweth, That at the very time of his ſecond appearing, all the Tribes of the Earth ſhall mourn; and doubtleſs they ſhall then mourn, not only by reaſon of ſin, but alſo by reaſon of pain and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhall be then upon them. Wherefore I infer from what hath been ſaid, That this preſent world is evil, and is likely to beget worſe, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſin, and alſo in reſpect of pain or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Yet I find in ſome Books printed of late years, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> that ſome men have dreamed of a great change in this world before the end, not for the worſe, but for the better; they ſay, That this old world in its latter age, and towards its end, ſhall grow better, and be more free from ſin and pain then ever it was; for ſay they, Upon the fall of Antichriſt there ſhall be a National Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and thereupon ſhall follow a great Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſuch a golden age for holineſs and happineſs as never hath been: Yea ſome of them have ſaid, That

But I would tell ſuch Dreamers, Surely a deep ſleep is fallen upon you; you ſleep in the day of ſpiritual light, and not in the night of ſpiritual darkneſs, as others do; you are more ſwayed by the letter, then by the proper ſence and ſcope of thoſe Scriptures which you bring for the proof of that phantaſtical New-World, of which you ſpeak: you balk the New-Teſtament, and hide your ſelves under the dark Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the Old; whereas you ſhould conſider, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles have ſo clearly interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prophets as touching the latter times, and have ſo fully ſtated the evil and perillous condition of them, that we need not appeal from them to the Prophets in this Argument. And whereas in your printed pages you quote divers paſſages out of the 11 Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as if they were pat and ſure for your opinion: I would tell you alſo, That you much miſtake the proper occaſion and ſcope of that Chapter; for you ſhould know, that the Apoſtle, in the ſaid Chapter, doth ſpeak of the Jews of his preſent time, and not of a latter off-ſpring of them, as may appear <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. and that the Jews of his then preſent time were ſome of them of Gods Election, and others not, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. and that thoſe of the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were ſome of them converted, and others were not, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. but as for ſuch as were unconverted among them, he was willing to convert and ſave them, and had a good hope to do it, as he ſheweth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15, 23, 24, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32.

               <p>To this I anſwer: It will be hard, if not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, <note place="margin">Sol.</note> for any to prove, either that theſe perillous days of ours do belong unto the morning of the latter times, or that the evening ſhall be leſs perillous then the morning hath been: Rather I think it may be proved, That the morning of the latter times was leſs perillous, both in reſpect of ſin and puniſhment, and more eximious for holineſs and happineſs, then the evening ſhall be. Wherefore, as I conceive, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction thus applied will not help at a dead lift, though it may be very uſeful as it may be applied ſome other way.</p>
               <p>And though it be true, that all ſuch unconverted Jews as belong to Gods Election ſhall in time be converted; yet it will be a ſweating task for any to prove from the 11 Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> or from any other place or places of Scripture, That there ſhall be an Univerſal or a National Converſion either of the preſent o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again, If this preſent world be evil in both the former reſpects, then the ſons of men ſhould not love it in thoſe reſpects, nor ſet their hearts upon it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we have no reaſon to hate this world, as it is Gods workmanſhip, nor as it is the place for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and true Converſion, nor as it is the place wherein much good may be received and done; and wherein we are to <hi>ſeek the Kingdom of God and his</hi>

               <p>The next Poſition to be proved, is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That this preſent world ſhall one day be diſſolved:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Poſit.</hi>
                  </note> And here by this preſent world, I underſtand the viſible Heavens and Earth that now are, together with the creatures and works which are in them, or ſhall be found in them at the latter day: For though the viſible Heavens and Earth which now are, may be called this preſent world (conſidered as a Continent) and the creatures and works in them, may be called the things of the world; yet all theſe together do but make up this whole viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world, as appears, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. And to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, is all one as to be brought to duſt; as when a mans body ſhall be diſſolved, it ſhall be brought to duſt, according to that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> So when this world ſhall be diſſolved, it ſhall be brought to duſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the nature of fire when it burns up any ſubſtance, to bring it to duſt and aſhes; and this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93010:23"/> preſent world ſhall be burnt up, (as I am to ſhew by and by,) therefore it ſhall be brought to duſt.</p>
               <p>And that I be not miſapprehended of any in this point, theſe three Cautions are to be conſidered before I come to prove my Poſition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I do not ſay, That this preſent world ſhall be annihilated or brought to nothing, as ſome have thought, becauſe the duſt hereof ſhall remain after its diſſolution, as the duſt of mans body ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſomewhile after its diſſolution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I grant, That ſome of Gods Elect ſhall be found alive in their bodies at the latter day, and that their bodies ſhall not be diſſolved, but ſhall be preſerved from the diſſolution that ſhall then come upon this world, as it is written, <hi>Then we which are alive, and remain, ſhall be caught up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the ayr, and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4, 17. but theſe only excepted, this whole viſible world ſhall be diſſolved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither do I ſay, That this preſent world ſhall be diſſolved altogether in reſpect of its Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Being, becauſe it ſhall have a Being, <hi>viz.</hi> a new form and manner of Being after its diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as when a man dyes, his body is diſſolved, not altogether in reſpect of its Eſſence and Being, becauſe mans body ſhall have a new form and manner of Being after its diſſolution, <hi>Job</hi> 14. 14. but when a man dyes, his body is diſſolved only in reſpect of its preſent or priſtine condition, and ſhall be no more ſuch a body as it was, either for ſubſtance or corrupt qualities, becauſe the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof ſhall be turned to duſt, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93010:24"/> or priſtine corrupt qualities thereof ſhal ceaſe. So when this preſent world ſhall be diſſolved, it ſhall not ceaſe to be altogether, becauſe it ſhall be again under a new form and condition, and that for ever, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66. 22. for which cauſe it is ſaid, That <hi>the Earth abideth for ever,</hi> Eccleſ. 1. 4. and it cannot abide for ever under its preſent form and condition, but doubtleſs it ſhall abide for ever under a new form, after its new Creation: and it is ſaid, that <hi>God hath eſtabliſhed the world never to be moved,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 30. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. 10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>Ier.</hi> 51. 15. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45. 18. Yet we know that this world ſhall be moved at its diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 26. But the meaning of theſe places places is, that after its new Creation it ſhall never be moved: So then, this preſent world ſhall be diſſolved only in reſpect of its preſent or priſtine condition; that is, it ſhall be no more ſuch a world as now it is, either for ſubſtance or corrupt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, becauſe the preſent ſubſtance of it ſhall be turned to duſt, and the preſent corrupt qualities and accounts of it ſhall be no more.</p>

                  </label> of four erroneous opinions.</p>
               <p>The firſt opinion is of ſuch as think that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world is eternal, in reſpect of its preſent form and condition, and ſo ſhall never be diſſolved; which was the opinion of <hi>Aristotle</hi> the Philoſopher, who was the more to be pitied, becauſe he knew not the Scriptures, nor the power of God, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in revealed: but we Chriſtians have known the Scriptures, and have read often in them of the end of the world, and therefore have no reaſon to hearken to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in this Aſſertion of his.</p>

               <p>The third opinion is of thoſe who think that this preſent world ſhall only be purged by fire, at the latter day, from its evil qualities, and not diſſolved: As the old world in <hi>Noahs</hi> time was drowned in reſpect of its ſuperficies, and in reſpect of ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in it, yet the ſubſtance of it remained firm: So ſay they, This preſent world ſhall be purged by fire from its corruptions and evil qualities, but the ſubſtance of Heaven and Earth ſhall remain as an everlaſting Monument of Gods Wiſdom and Power, Goodneſs and Mercy. But theſe are miſtaken alſo: For though I grant, That fire hath a purging and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining vertue, and that if the Lord ſhould reſtrain the fire of the great Day, before mentioned (as a Goldſmith reſtraineth the fire when the gold is in it) it ſhould only then purge and refine the world, and the ſubſtance thereof ſhould remain; yet the Scripture ſheweth plainly, That by the fire of that great Day, <hi>the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, the Earth alſo, and the works that are therein,</hi> (whether works of the firſt Creation, or works of nature, or works of mans art and induſtry) <hi>ſhall be burnt up,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10.

               <p>Secondly, In that next fore-quoted place of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> he teacheth, That all Chriſtians ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imious and exemplary before others in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that in all holy converſation and godlineſs; which exemplary obedience alſo is that which God commands at our hands, thus; <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works,</hi> Mat. 5. 16. It is that which will cauſe the obſervers

And it is that which ſhall not be forgotten another day, for they that exceed others here, in the practiſe of holineſs and vertue, ſhall exceed them alſo hereafter in glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Yea, it is that which many wil wiſh for, and many will rejoyce in at the time of this worlds diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: Therefore the certainty and nearneſs of this worlds diſſolution ſhould perſwade all Chriſtians to be exemplary before their brethren in all holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and godlineſs. Let us not then be altogether careleſs of a good converſation, with <hi>Gallio,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others: neither let us be of a looſe and diſſolute converſation, with the <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 1. Neither let us be of a ſcandalous converſation, with thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> through whom the Name of God was blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed among the <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 2. Neither let us be exemplary for wickedneſs, as <hi>Cain, Balaam</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> were: Neither let us be lukewarm in the practiſe of godlineſs, as the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> were: But let us ſtrive to excel in vertue, and to go before others in all holy converſation and godlineſs, remembering <hi>that whatſoever good any man doth, that ſhall he receive of God, whether he be bond or free,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 8.</p>
               <p>The third Poſition here to be proved, is, <hi>That</hi>

               <p>It ſhould be conſidered, firſt, That the World to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> come is often mentioned in Scripture as a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93010:29"/> not only of this preſent world, but alſo of the end of it; as, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12, 32. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 30. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. Yea I dare ſay, That whereſoever the World to come is mentioned in the Word of God, either in ſo many words, or by way of interpretation, it is mentioned as a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of the end of this world. Now that which ſhall be a Conſequent of the end of this world, ſhall have no Being before this preſent world ſhall be diſſolved and ended; but the World to come ſhall be a Conſequent of the end of this world: therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd of this world, then the World to come it ſelf ſhall have no Being before this preſent world ſhall be diſſolved: but the former is true; therefore the latter.</p>
               <p>And it ſhould be conſidered thirdly, That where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> there is an orderly ſucceſſion of collective bodies, there the Being of the latter doth pre-ſuppoſe the diſſolution of the former; as, the Monarchy of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93010:30"/> 
                  <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> had no Being before the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> was diſſolved; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Macedonians</hi> had no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Monarchy of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> was diſſolved; the Monarchy of the <hi>Romanes</hi> had no Being before the Monarchy of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Macedonians</hi> was diſſolved. And as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>David</hi> had no Being before the Kingdom of <hi>Saul</hi> was diſſolved, the Kingdom of <hi>Solomon</hi> had no Being before the Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> was diſſolved, and the Kingdom of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> had no Being before the Kingdom of <hi>Solomon</hi> was diſſolved: So the World to come ſhall be a collective body in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly ſucceſſion <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Which Poſition thus confirmed, makes againſt thoſe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> who think that the World to come ſhall be one thouſand years before the end of this preſent world: which is the opinion of Millenaries of theſe times; I do not ſay, it is the opinion of all of them, (becauſe Mr <hi>Mede</hi> being one, and not the leaſt of them, thinks <note place="margin">Mr <hi>Mede</hi> on <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4.</note> that this preſent world ſhall be diſſolved before the World to come ſhall have any Being:) but it is the opinion of many of them, who have thus expreſſed themſelves: That by the World to come the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means nothing elſe but an Univerſal Reformation-change all this world over, either in reſpect of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, as one ſaith, or in reſpect of Diſcipline at leaſt, as another of them ſaith; and that the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation-change ſhall be one thouſand years before the end of this world; therefore the World to come ſhall be one thouſand years before the end of this world. But I will tell theſe men, that this opinion of theirs hath four Errors involved or wrapped up in it.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:93010:30"/>
               <p> As, 1. It is an Error to think that there ſhall be an extraordinary or Univerſal Reformation-change, either in reſpect of Converſion, or in reſpect of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, before the end of this world; becauſe the conſtant current of the New Teſtament is againſt this conceit, and ſhews clearly, That the latter age of this world ſhall be a very deformed age, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the evil of ſin which ſhall abound therein, and alſo in reſpect of the evil of pain and trouble that ſhall follow thereupon, (as hath been before hinted;) nay it ſhews, That at the very time of Chriſts ſecond appearing in the Clouds, he ſhall find the world, I mean the people of this world, in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of ſecurity: <hi>For as in the days that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood, they were eating and drinking, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entred into the Ark, and knew not, until the Flood came, and took them all away; ſo ſhall alſo the Coming of the Son of man be,</hi> Mat. 24. 38, 39. In a poſture of unbelief: For <hi>when the Son of man cometh, ſhall he find faith on the earth?</hi> Luk. 18. 8. He may find ſome faith on the earth, but it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he ſhall then find but little faith, as touching his coming, and the World to come. In a poſture of Atheiſm, ſcoffing and ſcorning at Religion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at <hi>the promiſe of his coming,</hi> and of the end of the world; <hi>There ſhall come in the laſt days ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, walking after their own lusts,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 3. Yea, he ſhall then find the people of the world in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of War, beating their fellow Servants, and preparing a great battel againſt the Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 9. Wherefore I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould look for ſuch a Reformation-change as theſe men ſpeak of; yet I hope there ſhall be a Reformation-change
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93010:31"/> in many particular perſons before the end of this world; and its poſſible there may be a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation-change in ſome particular Countries, at leaſt in reſpect of Diſcipline: but that there ſhall be ſuch an extraordinary or Univerſal Reformation before the end of this world, far be it from me, and from my friends, ſo much as to dream thereof.</p>
               <p>2. It is an Error in theſe men to conceive that the end of this preſent world ſhall be a thouſand years off, after their ſuppoſed Reformation ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, or from this time, (as ſome of them ſay, it being now begun,) ſeeing the ſigns preſaging the end of the world, laid down in the New Teſtament, ſhould teach us to think otherwiſe: And for what other uſe ſerves this conceit of theirs? but to make men ſecure in their ſins, and to perſwade them that the <hi>Lord delays his coming,</hi> and to ſay in their hearts, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> Yea, for my part, I think, That the Son of man will be ſeen to come in the Clouds of Heaven, before ſuch a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation-change, as they ſpeak of, will be ſeen to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, or to be eſtabliſhed in the earth: And whereas they tell us of the <hi>Saints living and raigning with Chriſt a thouſand years,</hi> Rev. 20. 4. as if that place made much for them; I would have them know, that that place is not to be underſtood of Saints on earth, as if they ſhould live and raign with Chriſt in their bodies upon this corrupt earth a thouſand years by vertue of a Reformation-change in this world; but it is to be underſtood of Saints departed this life, now in the third Heaven, in reſpect of their Souls, where they were to live and raign with Chriſt for a thouſand years, or more, from the time when thoſe words were ſpoken, (a certain time being there put
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93010:31"/> for an uncertain,) even until his coming again from thence.</p>
               <p>3. It is an Error in theſe men to think, that by the World to come the Scripture means a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-change in this world, ſeeing by the World to come we are to underſtand a new created world, properly ſo called, that ſhall conſiſt of new Heavens and a new Earth, properly ſo called, and of new Creatures and occurrences in them, as I hope to ſhew more fully in my next Section: Yea the World to come ſhall be ſuch a world wherein the righteous ſhall <hi>inherit everlaſting life,</hi> Luk. 18. 30. but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing there ſhould be ſuch a Reformation-change in this world, as they dream of, yet we cannot therein inherit everlaſting life: therefore we may not underſtand by the World to come ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation-change.</p>
               <p>4. It is an Error in theſe men to confound the World to come with this preſent world, ſeeing the Scripture hath plainly diſtinguiſhed them in many places, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 32. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 30. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 21, &amp;c. And as the time to come cannot be all one with the time preſent, nor the time preſent with the time to come; ſo neither can the World to come be all one, or at one time, with this preſent world; nor this preſent world all one, or at one time, with the World to come: But leaving this phanſie of theirs, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>And I acknowledg in the fourth place, <hi>That the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4 <hi>Poſit.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>World to come ſhall begin immediately, or ſuddenly, upon the diſſolution of this preſent world;</hi> that is to ſay, as ſoon as this preſent world ſhall have an end, the World to come ſhall begin; as ſoon as theſe viſible Heavens ſhall be diſſolved, there ſhall be other
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93010:32"/> Heavens in their ſtead; as ſoon as this viſible Earth ſhall be diſſolved, there ſhall be another Earth in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, with other creatures in it: and ſo the World to come ſhall begin immediately or ſuddenly upon the diſſolution of this preſent world. For confirmation whereof, though I cannot produce any plain place of Scripture ſo clear as to convince all gain-ſayers, yet I can produce ſome probable grounds, ſuch as have ſatisfied my ſelf, as touching the truth of this Poſition.</p>
               <p>As, 1. The Scripture ſpeaks not of any ſpace of time, much leſs of any conſiderable ſpace of time that ſhall be, betwixt the diſſolution of this preſent world, and the Creation of the World to come: therefore it is probable that there ſhall be no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſpace of time betwixt them; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the World to come ſhall begin imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately or ſuddenly upon the diſſolution of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world.</p>
               <p>2. The Scripture ſpeaks of divers things that ſhall happen in and upon one and the ſame day, <hi>viz.</hi> the great Day of the Lord. As, 1. The diſſolution of this preſent world. 2. The Creation of the World to come. 3. The ſubduing of all Chriſts Enemies. 4. The Reſignation of the Kingdom to God even the Father. 5. The glorious Appearing of Chriſt. 6. The Reſurrection of the dead. 7. The Sentence of the laſt Judgment. And if all theſe things ſhall happen upon one and the ſame day, <hi>viz.</hi> the great Day of the Lord, then it is probable that there ſhall be no conſiderable ſpace of time betwixt them; and conſequently that the World to come ſhall begin immediately or ſuddenly upon the diſſolution of this preſent world.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:93010:32"/>
               <p> 3. I have ſeriouſly thought upon that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul; Then ſhall we which live, and remain, be caught up together with them in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the ayr,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 17. where he intimates, as I conceive, That the World to come ſhall be created after the ſame order in which this preſent world ſhall be diſſolved: And as this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world ſhall be diſſolved firſt in its upper part, <hi>viz.</hi> the viſible Heavens, Clouds and Ayr, which now are; ſo the World to come ſhall be created firſt in its upper part, <hi>viz.</hi> the new Heavens, Clouds and Ayr, &amp;c. and ſo the Saints, which ſhall be found living upon this corrupt earth, when the fire begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to ſeize upon it, ſhall be caught up together with the Saints that ſhall come with Chriſt, to meet him and them in the new Clouds and Ayr: for I cannot imagine, that either the Saints which ſhall come from Heaven, or thoſe that ſhall come from the Earth, ſhall meet in theſe corrupt Clouds and Ayr which now are; and ſo I may well gather from this place, <hi>That the World to come ſhall begin imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately or ſuddenly upon the diſſolution of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Poſition thus cleared, croſſeth a certain <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> opinion of Mr <hi>Mede</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In his Book on the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
                  </note>; for though he grants, That the World to come ſhall not begin before this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world ſhall be diſſolved, yet he thinks that the Day of Judgment ſhall continue for a thouſand years, and thereupon ſhall follow the World to come. But I would fain know what he means by the Day of Judgment in that place; whether the Day of Sentence, or the Day of Execution? If he mean the Day of Execution, he might as well have ſaid, the Day of Judgment ſhall continue for ever; for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93010:33"/> doubtleſs the Execution of the laſt Judgment ſhall continue for ever and ever: But if he mean the Day of Sentence, I wonder he ſhould ſay, the Day of Judgment ſhall continue a thouſand years, ſeeing no good reaſon can be given, why the Lord ſhould ſo long deliberate about the Sentence of Judgment. Notwithſtanding then this opinion of his, I am ſtill of the opinion, <hi>That the World to come ſhall begin immediately or ſuddenly upon the diſſolution of this preſent world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if ſo, there is no reaſon why good Chriſtians ſhould mourn, grieve, or be diſcouraged to hear of the diſſolution of this preſent world, ſeeing the World to come ſhall begin immediately hereupon: It is a comfort againſt the death of theſe corrupt bodies of ours to hear that we ſhall have other and better bodies after the death of theſe; ſo it ſhould be a comfort againſt the diſſolution of this world, to hear that there ſhall be another, and a better world after the diſſolution of this.</p>

               <p>Firſt, I affirm, That the World to come is taken <note place="margin">1 <hi>Ground.</hi>
                  </note> both ſtrictly and largely in the Word of God.</p>
               <p>It is ſtrictly taken, whereſoever the World to come is diſtinguiſhed from the matters and things
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93010:33"/> that ſhall be contained in it, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 32. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 30. and 20. 34, 35. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 5. in all which places it is mentioned by way of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

Wherefore ſuch might here be blamed as have ſpoken more or leſs of the World to come in a confuſed way, neither diſtinguiſhing thereof, nor ſhewing what they mean thereby, ſeeing it is a received Maxime, That ambiguous and doubtful terms ſhould firſt be diſtinguiſhed, and afterwards <note place="margin">Ambigua priua di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguenda.</note> defined or deſcribed: But the very name of the World to come is ambiguous, yet they have not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed it unto this day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I affirm, That (in regard of the former <note place="margin">2 <hi>Ground.</hi>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93010:34"/> as it ſhall be a Country or Continent, That they have not methodically proceeded as concerning this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For if a man ſhould write a large hiſtory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this preſent world, and therein ſhould ſay nothing of it as it is a Continent, might we not well ſay, Surely ſuch a man was never throughly adviſed as touching the buſineſs he took in hand?

               <p>Thirdly, I affirm, That the World to come, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <note place="margin">3 <hi>Ground.</hi>
                  </note> as a Continent, ſhall conſiſt of new Heavens and a new Earth; that is to ſay, of new created Heavens, and a new created Earth.

               </p>
               <p>Other Scripture-paſſages might be produced for the ratification of this ground; but I am loath to burthen the Reader with any more in this place.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I affirm, <hi>That the World to come, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4 <hi>Ground.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>as a Continent, ſhall in ſome things corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond and accord with this preſent world:</hi> As in theſe particulars;</p>
               <p n="1">1. This preſent world, conſidered as a Continent, conſiſteth of viſible Heavens, and a viſible Earth; And here, by viſible Heavens, we commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, both the Airy Heaven, which is now next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us, and the Starry Heaven, which is now next above that. And here alſo, by a viſible Earth, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly underſtand both the dry Land, and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which now are: <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 9. So the World to come, conſidered as a Continent, ſhall conſiſt of viſible Heavens, and a viſible Earth, as may appear by what hath been ſaid upon the former ground. <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4, 17 Dan. 12, 3</note> And here again, by viſible Heavens, I underſtand both that Airy Heaven, and that Starry Heaven, which ſhall be created upon the diſſolution of theſe which now are. And alſo by a viſible Earth, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand both that dry Land, and thoſe Waters, which ſhall be created upon the diſſolution of theſe which now are.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This preſent world, conſidered as a Continent, received its beginning by Creation, and was created by God himſelf: <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
               <p>So the World to come, conſidered as a Continent,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93010:39"/> ſhall receive its beginning by Creation, and ſhall be created by God himſelf: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65. 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 66. 22. Yet I dare not ſay, that it ſhall be created of nothing, as this preſent world was. Indeed it is poſſible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with God to create it of nothing pre-exiſtent: Yet it ſeems more probable to me, that it ſhall be created of the duſt of this preſent world, after it ſhall be burnt up, and brought to duſt; As the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men, women, and children, in their Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ſhall be formed or created of the duſt of their old bodies. But I will not contend for this, as for a matter of Faith: It's enough for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that the World to come ſhall be created by God himſelf, either of nothing, or of ſomething; and if of ſomething, then it's probable that it may be created, as well of the duſt of this, as of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This preſent world, conſidered as a Continent, doth contain in it variety of Creatures; ſome rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, ſome irrational: So the World to come, as a Continent, ſhall contain in it variety of Creatures; ſome rational, ſome irrational; as I intend to ſhew in the next part of this Treatiſe, after I ſhall have ſpoken of the more principal matters of the World to come.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I affirm, <hi>That the World to come, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidened</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5 <hi>Ground.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>as a Continent, ſhall differ from this preſent world, both for ſubstance and qualities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it ſhall differ from this preſent world, for qualities, or as touching its qualities, is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by many Writers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe this preſent world waxeth old like a garment, and is grown decrepit; but that to come ſhall be new.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:93010:39"/> 2. Becauſe this is corruptible; but that ſhall be incorruptible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe this is mutable, and moveable; but that ſhall be immutable, and immoveable: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66. 22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe this is polluted, and defiled; but that ſhall be undefiled.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe this ſhall have an end; but that ſhall be everlaſting, without end.</p>
               <p>For which cauſes the World to come muſt needs differ from this preſent world, for qualities, or, in and touching its qualities. And hereunto I add,</p>
               <p>That it ſhall differ alſo from this preſent world, for ſubſtance, or as touching the ſubſtance of it:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the World to come ſhall not be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, before the ſubſtance of this world, as a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, ſhall be burnt up, and brought to duſt; as hath been before ſhewed: And if ſo, then the World to come muſt needs be another from this for ſubſtance, and ſo differ from this as touching the ſubſtance of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the World to come ſhall not be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated of the ſubſtance of this preſent world; but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhall be created of nothing, or of ſomething that ſhall not be the ſubſtance of this. And ſuppoſe it ſhal be created of the duſt of this; yet it wil not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon follow, that it ſhall be created of the ſubſtance of this. For as the duſt of a mans body, after it is burnt to aſhes, cannot properly be called the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his body; ſo neither can the duſt of this preſent world, after it ſhall be burnt to aſhes, be properly called the ſubſtance of this world. And ſeeing the World to come ſhall not be created of the ſubſtance of this; it will neceſſarily follow,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93010:40"/> That it ſhall be another from this, and ſhall differ from this, as touching the ſubſtance of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Unleſs the World to come ſhall differ from this in and for the ſubſtance of it, I cannot ſee how it can differ from it, in and for the qualities of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe where any natural ſubſtance remains, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural qualities of it are wont to remain too: As when, in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, the world then was drowned with a flood, the natural ſubſtance of it remained, and the natural qualities too, though the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of it was much altered for a while. But it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many (as I ſaid) <hi>That the world to come ſhall differ from this for qualities:</hi> Therefore I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the premiſſes; <hi>That the World to come, conſidered as a Continent, ſhall differ from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world, and be another from it, both for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and qualities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, I affirm, <hi>That the World to come, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">6 <hi>Ground.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>as a Continent, ſhall be the ſame, for eſſence and eſſential properties, with this preſent world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus our new bodies, after the laſt Reſurrection, ſhall be the ſame, for eſſence and eſſential properties, with theſe bodies which now we have. And as it is eſſential to theſe bodies, which now we have, to to conſiſt of fleſh and bones, of eyes, ears, hands, and feet, &amp;c. So it ſhall be eſſential to our new bodies, after the laſt Reſurrection, to conſiſt of fleſh and bones, of eyes, ears, hands, and feet, &amp;c. <hi>For I my ſelf ſhall behold him</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) with theſe ſame eyes, Job</hi> 19. 27. Yet our new bodies ſhall not be the ſame with theſe for ſubſtance; for <hi>thou ſowest not that body that ſhall be,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 37. Neither ſhal they be the ſame with theſe for qualities; for <hi>that which is ſown in corruption, ſhall riſe again in incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:93010:40"/> 
                  <hi>that which is ſown in diſhonor, ſhall be raiſed in glory, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42, 43, 44.</p>
               <p>So the World to come ſhall be the ſame, for eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and eſſential properties, with this preſent world. And as it is eſſential to this world, to be Gods Creation and Workmanſhip, to conſiſt of viſible Heavens, and a viſible Earth, to be a round world, and of large extent: So ſhall it be eſſential to the World to come, to be Gods Creation and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, to conſiſt of viſible Heavens, and a viſible Earth, to be a round world, and of large extent. And ſo much I gather from this Scripture-Maxim; <hi>God hath establiſhed the world, never to be moved, Pſal.</hi> 96. 10. whereas we know that this preſent world ſhall be moved at the time of its diſſolution, in reſpect of its preſent ſubſtance and qualities: but the meaning is. That it ſhall never be moved, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its eſſence, becauſe this ſhall continue, not onely until, but after its new Creation. I infer then, <hi>That the World to come ſhall be the ſame with this, for eſſence and eſſential properties; though it ſhall not be the ſame with it for ſubstance and qualities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſix Grounds, thus cleared, make for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> of three Errors.</p>
               <p>The firſt Error is of thoſe who think, <hi>That the World to come ſhall be nothing elſe, but that bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heaven, or third Heaven, which now is.</hi> Which Opinion (as I take it) hath been effectually confuted before, in my ſecond <hi>Section:</hi> and ſo I need ſay no more of it in this place.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the Error of thoſe who think, <hi>That the World to come ſhall be the ſame, for ſubstance, with this preſent world.</hi> Which Error (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) hath been ſubſtantially refuted in my two laſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93010:41"/> Grounds upon this <hi>Section.</hi> For though I grant in one of them, <hi>That the World to come ſhall be the ſame, for eſſence, with this world;</hi> yet I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the other, <hi>That it ſhall not be the ſame, for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, with it.</hi> And therefore I will ſay no more at this time concerning this matter.</p>
               <p>The third is the Error of thoſe who think, <hi>That the World to come, as a Continent, ſhall not conſist of new Heavens, and a new Earth; becauſe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>where ever the Scripture ſpeaks of new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and a new Earth, it ſpeaks of a new reformed Church in this life, all the world over, before the end of it; and not of the World to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Opinion hath obtained many Patrons, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates, and Followers, of late years, and in theſe Times; who have hereupon fancyed to themſelves ſtrange Forms of Religion, and ſtrange Forms of Government and Diſcipline, as neceſſary to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Church in theſe latter Times. But all of them have juſtly deſerved to be cenſured by the Church. 1. Becauſe they have put a falſe gloſs, or interpretation, upon thoſe places which ſpeak of the <hi>new Heavens, and a new Earth.</hi> 2. Becauſe they make uſe of a figurative or allegorical interpretation, when the proper and litteral ſence is onely right and orthodox. 3. Becauſe they wreſt many other places of Scripture in favor of this interpretation. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that concluſion, which they intend to prove by their wreſtings, is groſly erroneous in it ſelf: <hi>viz. That there ſhall be ſuch a Reformed Church all the world over,</hi> as they ſpeak of, <hi>before the end come,</hi> as I have before ſhewed. Wherefore though I have here fit occaſion given for to examine their Books, and to diſcover their ſeveral Miſtakes and Errors;

They had alſo in them a good hope of the world to come, wherein ſuch things are to be found.</p>
               <p>If it be here asked, why beleeving Chriſtians ſhould hope for the world to come? I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The world to come is often promiſed in the Word of God; and for this cauſe we should look and hope for it: <hi>Nevertheleſs, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, we look for new Heavens, and a new Earth,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13.</p>

               <p n="4">4. This hope of the world to come is called <hi>the hope of our calling, Eph.</hi> 1. 18. becauſe it should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Chriſtian Calling: And for this cauſe it should not be wanting in us.</p>

                  </note> us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the very punctual time, that is, the day and hour of this Coming of his, is known only to God himſelf, not to men, nor to Angels, nor to Chriſt himſelf, as he is the Son of man: <hi>For of that day, and that hour, knoweth no man, no not the Angels which are in Heaven, neither the Son, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Mark 13. 32. And in this ſence our Saviour ſaid unto his followers, <hi>It is not for you to know the times and the ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his own power,</hi> Acts 1. 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we ſhould not think the time of this his ſecond Coming to be far off, becauſe the Scripture ſpeaks of it as of that which is near at hand, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 10. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 8. wherefore, if we will judg according to Scripture, we ſhould judg it to be near at hand: And ſeeing the moſt part of thoſe ſigns, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage this ſecond Coming of his, have been already obſerved in the world, and the reſt of them are dayly expected, it ſeems unreaſonable to me, that any ſhould think it to be far off, or yet a thouſand years off, as ſome have thought.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the day of this his ſecond Coming ſhall be a long day, and longer then any that hath been, or ſhall be before it; for it ſhall be ſomewhat like that day in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time, when the Sun and the Moon ſtood ſtill in the midſt of Heaven, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. 12, 13, 14. and it ſhall be ſuch a day as is deſcribed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zechariah,</hi> in which it <hi>ſhall not be clear nor</hi>

                  <hi>dark, but it ſhall be one day which ſhall be known to the Lord, not day nor night, but it ſhall come to paſs that at evening time it ſhall be light,</hi> Zech. 14. 6, 7. Yea, we may well conceive that it ſhall be a very long day, becauſe of the great tranſactions that ſhall be in it; for on that day ſhall be, 1. The diſſolution of this preſent world. 2. The Creation of the World to come. 3. The ſubduing of all Chriſts Enemies unto him. 4. The Reſignation of the Kingdom of Heaven unto God the Father. 5. The Appearing of the Son of man. 6. The Reſurrection of all the dead. And 7. The Sentence of the laſt Judgment. So it muſt needs be a long day, that ſhall be famous for all theſe tranſactions.</p>
               <p>And hereunto I add, That though the punctual time of his ſecond Coming in the Fleſh be known only to God; yet ſome Divines think, that the yearly or annual time of the worlds end, and his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Coming, are not obſcurely pointed at in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by thoſe numbers of 1260. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 3. of 1290. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11. of 666. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 18. of 1335. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 12. For ſay they, If theſe numbers were rightly <note place="margin">

               <p>But it may be here demanded, Whether Chriſt <label type="milestone">

                  </label> ſhall come from the third Heaven at this next Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of his, with a purpoſe to leave it?</p>
               <p>To which demand I anſwer thus: Firſt, The third <label type="milestone">

Secondly, It may be conſidered as it is now the place of Chriſts humane Nature, wherein
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93010:50"/> he raigneth with the Father as God and man in on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Coming from the third Heaven, ſhall leave it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, never to poſſeſs it again as formerly, nor as the conſtant place of his habitation: yet I deny not but conceive, that after this deſcention of his he may be taken up again in his humane Nature at ſome times into the third Heaven, for ſome ends known only to God, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> once was before hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> death: but ſtill I think, that at his next Return from this Heaven in his humane Nature, he ſhall leave i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> altogether as the dwelling place of his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The third Heaven was not promiſed to Chriſt for an everlaſting habitation, but only for a certain time, as may be ſeen in theſe places; <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footſtool,</hi> Pſal. 110. 1. <hi>He muſt raign, till he (viz.</hi> the Father) <hi>hath put all enemies under his feet,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 25. And that which is here promiſed ſhall be made good unto him at his ſecond Coming, and not before: And if the third Heaven be not promiſed unto him for an everlaſting habitation, but for ſuch a time as is expreſſed in the promiſe, then we may well think, That at his ſecond Coming from this Heaven he ſhall leave it altogether, as it is the dwelling place of his humane Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſaid, That this third Heaven ſhall receive or contain Chriſt but for a certain time, <hi>viz. until the times of reſtitution of all things,</hi> Acts 3. 21. that is, until the World to come ſhall be created, and all things therein ſhall be reſtored, according to the Decrees and Promiſes of God: And if ſo, then doubtleſs Chriſt at his ſecond Coming from this
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93010:50"/> Heaven ſhall leave it altogether, conſidered as the dwelling place of his humane Nature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is written, That Chriſt at his ſecond Coming from this Heaven <hi>ſhall reſign or deliver up the Kingdom to God even the Father,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 24. And what Kingdom is this that he ſhall then deliver up to his Father? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I do not ſay, with ſome Writers, That he ſhall then deliver up his Mediatory Kingdom to his Father; becauſe this Kingdom (which belongs unto him as he is the Son of <hi>David)</hi> ſhall have no end, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 33. Neither, 2. do I ſay with others, That he ſhall then deliver up his Church-Kingdom unto his Fathers ſole diſpoſe and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe the Government of the Church, both Militant and Triumphant, is laid upon Chriſts ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as a Mediator, and ſhall never be taken off from him, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9. 6, 7. Neither, 3. do I ſay with others, That he ſhall then deliver up his Repreſentative Kingdom (conſiſting of outward Ordinances and Adminiſtrations now in uſe) to be aboliſhed by his Father; becauſe theſe things ſhall ceaſe and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of their own accord, and be aboliſhed before his ſecond Coming at leaſt in order of nature. But I ſay, That he ſhall then reſign and deliver up the Kingdom of Heaven, properly ſo called (as it is his Fathers perſonal Kingdom) unto the ſole diſpoſe and Government of his Father, that ſo his Father may be all in all in it, as he was before Chriſts coming thither, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. And if he ſhall reſign this Kingdom to God even the Father, then we may well think, That at his next Coming from this Heaven in his humane Nature, he ſhall leave it altogether, as it is the dwelling place of his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:93010:51"/> 4. It is ſaid, That Chriſt, after his next Coming from Heaven in the Fleſh, <hi>ſhall be ſubject to him that put all things under him,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 28. that is, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, While Chriſt remains in the third Heaven in his humane Nature, and as the perſon of a Mediator, we are not to conſider him as the Fathers Subject, becauſe he is there after a ſort equal with his Father, his Father having advanced him at his own right hand, upon his own Throne, and having given unto him all power in Heaven and in Earth: but after his coming from thence he ſhall be ſubject to his Father, as he was before his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and if ſo, then doubtleſs at his ſecond Coming from this Heaven he ſhall leave it, as the dwelling place of his humane Nature.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Have we never read, That Chriſt, after his perſonal Coming from this third Heaven, ſhall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs his own perſonal Kingdom, and ſit upon his own perſonal Throne, according to his Fathers appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? <hi>Luk.</hi> 19, 12. and 22. 29. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21.

                  </note> he ſhall come, when he ſhall come again in the Fleſh: And ſo I cannot think that he ſhall come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from Heaven into this polluted world; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this will be no fit place for a glorified Perſon to be and reſide in: but doubtleſs he ſhall come again from Heaven into the World to come, which ſhall be created inſtead of this; that is, into the new Heavens, and the new Earth: And ſo firſt he ſhall come into
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93010:51"/> the new Heavens, there to be made viſible to the Inhabitants of this Earth, that ſome of them, <hi>viz.</hi> his friends, may be caught up together in the Clouds to meet him in the ayr of the new Heaven, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 17. and that others, <hi>viz.</hi> his enemies, may be afflicted and aſtoniſhed to behold him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7. And from thence he ſhall deſcend unto the new Earth, there to reſide and dwell for ever, and all his Saints with him; as it is written, <hi>We look for new Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein ſhall dwell Righteouſneſs, viz.</hi> the Lord our Righteouſneſs, with all his righteous Ones, and nothing elſe but Righteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. And as it is written again, <hi>Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them,</hi> Rev. 21. 3. Yea, this dwelling of Chriſt and his Saints upon the new Earth, was lively repreſented unto us at the time of his Transfiguration upon the Mount; for then and there Chriſt himſelf, with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Mat. 17.</note> in a humane ſhape, and <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Master, it is good for us to be here;</hi> that is, to reſide or dwell here; <hi>let us build three Tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moſes, and one for Elias:</hi> By which Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration we are plainly taught what ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>But here perhaps ſome will be ready to object and <label type="milestone">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93010:52"/> as we may well conceive for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the World to come will be more ſuitable and proportionable unto humane bodies and natures then the third Heaven now is.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. Becauſe in the World to come all Chriſts Enemies ſhall be manifeſtly ſubdued unto him; whereas now, while he remains in the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we cannot ſee all things put under him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe in the World to come the Saints ſhall raign with Chriſt both in ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that for ever; whereas now in the third Heaven they raign with him onely in reſpect of Souls, and that but for a time. Theſe things conſidered, I am ſo far from thinking, that it will be a diſhonour to Chriſt and his Saints, when they ſhall leave the third Heaven, for to reſide upon the new Earth, that I rather think it will be an encreaſe or augmentation of honour and glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. To beware of Atheiſm, that they be not found Atheiſts in this point, for they that are Atheiſts in this particular will ſcoff at this doctrine, as it is ſaid, <hi>There ſhall come in the last days ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts, and ſaying, Where is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his Coming?</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 3, 4. and it ſhall be evil for ſuch at that day.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. To beware of intemporance and exceſs in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, and the cares of this life: <hi>Take heed, leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfeting, and drunkenneſs, and the cares of this life, and ſo that day come upon you unawares,</hi> Luk. 21. 34.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To beware of ſecurity, that we do <hi>not ſleep as do others,</hi> and promiſe our ſelves <hi>peace and ſafety</hi> in our ſins; becauſe <hi>ſudden deſtruction ſhall come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch, as travel upon a woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 3, 6.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To beware of cauſeleſs contention and ſtrife
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93010:54"/> with our neighbors: For <hi>if a ſervant ſhall ſay in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming, and ſhall begin to beat the men-ſervants and maidens, the Lord of that ſervant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in ſunder, and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him his portion with unbelievers,</hi> Luke 12. 45, 46.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To beware of all erroneous opinions about this Subject. And ſeeing we have ſuch clear In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations in the Word of God concerning it, it will be dangerous for us to liſten to any Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions contrary to theſe; or to entertain any errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinions in reference to this ſecond Coming of Chriſt in the Fleſh: of which ſort I have met with ſome created at this day.</p>
               <p>As one ſaith, There ſhall be a third Coming of <note place="margin">Mr <hi>J. Arch</hi>
                  </note> Chriſt in the Fleſh, to which many Scriptures, before quoted, properly belong, as he thinks; and that his ſecond Coming in the Fleſh ſhall be only to raiſe the dead Saints, and to ſet up his Kingdom upon this Earth, and to eſtabliſh it in the hands of all his dead and living Saints, whereupon he ſhall withdraw himſelf into Heaven again, until his third Coming at the end of the world: whereas the Scripture ſpeaks plainly but of two Comings of his in the Fleſh, and ſhews, That as his firſt Coming in the Fleſh was to <hi>take away ſin;</hi> ſo his ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall be <hi>without ſin, unto Salvation,</hi> Hebr. 9 28.</p>
               <p>Another ſaith, That his ſecond Coming in the Fleſh is yet far off, a thouſand years off at leaſt.</p>
               <p>Another ſaith, That his ſecond Coming in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93010:54"/> Fleſh ſhall not be before there ſhall be a National Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which ſhall occaſion a more full Converſion of <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another ſaith, That his ſecond Coming in the Fleſh ſhall be into this corrupt world.</p>
               <p>Another ſaith, That after his ſecond Coming in the Fleſh he ſhall return bodily into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there to reſide for ever, and his Saints with him.</p>
               <p>But I reſcent theſe opinions as ſo many wild fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies or foperies, ſuch as have no footing at all in the Word of God: And though I might here fill many pages with a large Confutation of them; yet I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, becauſe I deſire to furniſh the Reader with more profitable matter, and do think, that by the light of the former Informations the judicious Reader may diſcern the darkneſs of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.</p>
               <p>Again, That which hath been ſaid touching the ſecond Coming of Chriſt in the Fleſh ſhould exhort and perſwade all men, to whom theſe tydings ſhall come, to theſe following duties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be watchful againſt ſin and Satan, that we may keep a good Conſcience in all things: <hi>Sleep not as do others, but watch, and be ſober,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 6. <hi>Behold, I come as a thief, bleſſed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, leſt he be found naked, and they ſee his ſhame,</hi> Rev. 16. 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To beleeve his ſecond Coming in the Fleſh aſſuredly, ſeeing we have no reaſon to doubt thereof, and ſeeing they that beleeve not this are no better then Atheiſts; and Chriſt ſhall come to <hi>be admired in them that beleeve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To look for, that is, to hope for, this ſecond

               <p n="4">4. To love this ſecond Coming of his, ſeeing there ſhall be <hi>a Crown of Righteouſneſs for ſuch as love his Appearing,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To pray for this ſecond Coming of his, that it may be haſtened, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 20. and <hi>that we may be accounted worthy to ſtand before him at that day,</hi> Luk. 21. 36.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To be diligent whiles we live, both in our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and particular Callings: For <hi>bleſſed is that man, whom the Lord when he cometh, ſhall find ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <head>SECT. VI. <hi>Touching the laſt Reſurrection.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS the ſecond Coming of Chriſt in the Fleſh is one of the firſt things which ſhall be made vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the World to come: So the laſt Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is another of them which ſhall be made viſible too upon the ſame day with his ſecond Coming, if not at the ſame inſtant. And touching this Subject alſo the Scripture informeth us of divers things: As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It informeth us, That the laſt Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">1 <hi>Informat.</hi>
                  </note> is to be diſtinguiſhed from a ſpiritual Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe all that have now a lively faith are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of a ſpiritual Reſurrection, in that they are <hi>quickened together with Chriſt, and are riſen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:93010:55"/> 
                  <hi>with him,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 5, 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. according to his promiſe, <hi>The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voyce of the Son of man, and they that hear ſhall live,</hi> Joh. 5. 25. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as none of them are yet partakers of the laſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe a ſpiritual Reſurrection is all one with Regeneration, being that Grace of God whereby men are quickened ſpiritually, and ſo raiſed from the death of ſin unto the life of Righteouſneſs, and tranſlated from death unto life in a ſpiritual ſenſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. but the laſt Reſurrection ſhall not be all one with Regeneration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe a ſpiritual Reſurrection is called the firſt Reſurrection, and that properly, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 5. 6. but the laſt Reſurrection ſhall not be the firſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe this ſpiritual Reſurrection is proper only unto ſuch as are or ſhall be bleſſed and holy; as it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed and holy is he that hath part in the firſt Reſurrection, for upon ſuch the ſecond death hath no power; but they ſhall be Prieſts of God and of Chriſt, and ſhall raign with him a thouſand years,</hi> Rev. 20. 6. <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſtate of the firſt and ſpiritual Reſurrection: but the laſt Reſurrection ſhall not be proper only unto ſuch as are or ſhall be bleſſed and holy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe this ſpiritual Reſurrection is not a bodily Reſurrection, from a bodily death: but the laſt Reſurrection ſhall be a bodily Reſurrection, from a bodily death. And ſo for theſe Reaſons the laſt Reſurrection is to be diſtinguiſhed from a ſpiritual Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It informeth us, That the laſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <note place="margin">2 <hi>Informat.</hi>
                  </note> is to be diſtinguiſhed from all corporal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93010:56"/> that have been heretofore.

The dead man that was caſt into the Sepulchre of <hi>Eliſha</hi> was raiſed from death to life, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 21. The Rulers daughter was raiſed from death to life by our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 25. The widow of <hi>Naims</hi> ſon was raiſed from death to life by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 14, 15. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> after he had been in the grave four days, was raiſed from death to life by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 43, 44. <hi>Tabitha</hi> was raiſed from death to life by the power of God in the Miniſtry of <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 40. <hi>Eutichus,</hi> that fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead, was raiſed again by the power of God in the Miniſtry of S. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20. 10. Yea we read, That when Chriſt was crucified, <hi>the graves were opened, and many bodies of Saints which ſlept, aroſe, and came out of the graves, after his Reſurrection, and went into the holy City, and appeared unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> Mat. 27. 52, 53. Yet I ſay, That the laſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is to be diſtinguiſhed from all theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe theſe Reſurrections are ſo many pledges and fore-going ſigns of the laſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe theſe Reſurrections were but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ones: but the laſt Reſurrection ſhall be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe theſe Reſurrections left men in a ſtate of mortality, and in poſſibility of a corporal death:
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93010:56"/> but the laſt Reſurrection ſhall not leave men in ſuch a condition.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It informeth us, That the laſt Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">3 <hi>Informat.</hi>
                  </note> ſhall be common to all dead people, men, women and children; whether good or bad, juſt or unjuſt, Elect or Reprobates. Indeed ſome men ſhall be found living at the ſecond Appearing of Chriſt, who ſhall be caught up in the Clouds to meet him in the ayr, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 17. and ſo they ſhall neither dye, nor riſe again, only they ſhall be changed, and this change ſhall be unto them inſtead of a Reſurrection; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 51. <hi>We ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed:</hi> Yet doubtleſs all men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that ſhall be found dead at that day, of what ſort or quality ſoever, ſhall be raiſed again in their bodies, and their Souls ſhall come into them again, that in Soul and body united they may live for ever, either in a ſtate of Bliſs, or in a ſtate of miſery: For the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith in the plural number, not excepting any, <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, together with my dead body, ſhall they ariſe: Awake, and ſing, ye that dwell in the duſt; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead,</hi> Iſai. 26. 19. S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſaw the dead, ſmall</hi>

                  <hi>and great, ſtand before God,</hi> Rev. 20. 12, 13. And how can this be, unleſs all the dead, both ſmall and great ſhall riſe again? And though the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, That <hi>many of them which ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake,</hi> Dan. 12. 2. Yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he means all ſuch ſleepers, who, when they ſhall be divided into two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, ſhall be but many of each ſort: And ſo the laſt Reſurrection ſhall be common to all dead peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, men, women and children.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:93010:57"/>
               <p> Howbeit, we muſt acknowledg ſome difference between the Reſurrection of the juſt and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The juſt, and ſuch as have done good with acceptance, ſhall come forth to the Reſurrection of life: but the unjuſt, and ſuch as have done evil without repentance, ſhall come forth to the reſurrection of condemnation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 29.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The juſt, and ſuch as have done good, with acceptance, ſhall have a priority in the laſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; <hi>The dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe first,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 16. if not in time, yet in dignity: but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and ſuch as have done evil, without repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſhall have a poſteriority in the laſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that is, they ſhall riſe laſt, though not in time, yet in dignity, and ſo ſhall be leſs honorable in this Reſurrection, then the juſt ſhall be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The juſt, and ſuch as have done good, with acceptance, ſhall riſe again, not only by the power of the Trinity, but alſo by the power of Chriſt as Mediator, by vertue of his Merit and their Union with him: but the unjuſt, and ſuch as have done evil, without repentance, ſhall riſe again only by the power of the Trinity, and not by the power of Chriſt as their Mediator, nor by vertue of his Merit and their Union with him, ſeeing they have no Union with him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It informeth us, That the laſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <note place="margin">

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:93010:57"/> 1. Becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking largely of the laſt Reſurrection, doth reſtrain it to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, excepting dead birds, beaſts, and fiſhes, from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The reaſon why dead men and women ſhall riſe again, is, becauſe they have reaſonable Souls living while their bodies are dead, as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Dives, Lazarus,</hi> are now alive in their Souls, their bodies being dead: but other creatures, as birds, beaſts, fiſhes, have no ſouls liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing while their bodies are dead: for there is this difference betwixt a man and a beaſt, that when a man dyeth his ſpirit lives and aſcends to God that gave it, but when a beaſt dies his ſpirit dies with him and returns to duſt; which is a matter well known &amp; conſidered but of a few, therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who knoweth the ſpirit of a man, that goeth upward; and the ſpirit of the beaſt, that goeth downward to the earth?</hi> Eccleſ. 3. 21. And from hence alſo I may infer, That the laſt Reſurrection ſhall be proper only unto mankind, and not common to other creatures with them.</p>
               <p>But here it may be objected, 1. There ſhall be <label type="milestone">

                  </label> World to come beſide mankind; yet I conceive, that thoſe other creatures ſhall receive their Being only by way of Creation, and not by way of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, after the manner of mankind: and ſo from the Being of other creatures in the next World we cannot infer the Reſurrection of ſuch crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>2. There ſhall be <hi>a reſtitution of all things</hi> at the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> ſecond Coming of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. And doth not this import the Reſurrection of other creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide man?</p>
               <p>It doth not; becauſe this reſtitution is there li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> to all things before promiſed by the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: Now God hath no where promiſed by his holy Prophets the Reſurrection of other creatures beſide mankind; therefore we cannot prove from this place the Reſurrection of other creatures.</p>
               <p>3. But there is a large deliverance promiſed to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>3</label> other creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the creature it ſelf ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 21. and doth not this deliverance include a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of other creatures beſide mankind.</p>
               <p>It doth not: For though I grant, 1. That in this <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> promiſe the creature is diſtinguiſhed from mankind, who are the children of God either by Creation or Adoption: And, 2. That the liberty here promiſed belongs to both. Yet we muſt underſtand, that they ſhall enjoy it in a different way: For mankind, the children of God, ſhall enjoy this liberty or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by vertue of the laſt Reſurrection and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but other creatures ſhall enjoy it only by vertue of the laſt Creation. Wherefore I beleeve
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93010:58"/> ſtill, That the laſt Reſurrection ſhall be proper to mankind, and not common to other creatures with them, whatſoever others have ſaid or written to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It informeth us, That the laſt Reſurrection <note place="margin">5 <hi>Informat.</hi>
                  </note> ſhall be ſure and certain, and that which none ſhould doubt of; becauſe the Scripture doth make it ſure unto us by three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By plain Teſtimonies, ſuch as cannot be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. 19. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 28, 29. <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 15, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Types, Parables and ſimilitudes: Thus the budding of <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, after it was dry like the other, was a Type to aſſure us of the Reſurrection of our bodies, <hi>Numb.</hi> 17. 8. Thus the tranſlation of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> was a Type to aſſure us, that in and after the laſt Reſurrection we ſhall live in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as they are now alive in their bodies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. Thus the Parable of the dry bones living again was written to aſſure us, that our bodies ſhall live again after death, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 3, 6. and the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of ſeed reviving after it is dead in the earth, is to aſſure us of the laſt Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 36, 37.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By Arguments or Reaſons: The one taken from the Reſurrection of Chriſt; for if Chriſt be riſen, then all dead men and women ſhall one day riſe again by the ſame power of the Godhead: but Chriſt is riſen from the dead, as is made apparent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20, 21. therefore all dead men and women ſhall riſe again. Another is taken from Baptiſm: one end whereof is to aſſure men of the laſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and Baptiſm ſhould be in vain, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect, if there ſhould not be a Reſurrection: but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93010:59"/> Baptiſm ſhall not be in vain in this reſpect; <hi>erg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> there ſhall be a general Reſurrection. Another i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> taken from the ſufferings of the godly in this world for they are wont to ſuffer much in hope of the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Reſurrection, and ſuch ſufferings of theirs ſhould be in vain, if there ſhould be no ſuch Reſurrection 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. but their ſufferings ſhall not be in vain; therefore, without doubt, there ſhall be ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. And another is taken from Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> to be their God, and the God of their ſeed for ever: And how can this be made good without a general Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, whereby the bodies of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and their ſeed, ſhall be made alive again, that ſo they may both live for ever in ſouls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies united, and God may be their God for ever, ſeeing <hi>he is not the God of the dead, but of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Mat. 22. 32. Wherefore none ſhould doubt of the laſt Reſurrection, ſeeing the Scripture doth ſo many ways aſſure us of it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It informeth us, That the laſt Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">6 <hi>Informat.</hi>
                  </note> ſhall have divers Cauſes; as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The efficient Cauſe of it, ſhall be the whole Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, That <hi>the Lord killeth and maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 6. And it is <hi>God that raiſeth the dead,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The meritorious cauſe of it, ſhall be Chriſt as Mediator, who merited the Reſurrection from the dead: but he merited it only for the Elect; and ſo the Elect ſhall be raiſed, not only by the power of the Trinity, but alſo by the power of Chriſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, both by vertue of his Merit, and efficacious
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93010:59"/> Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. and alſo by vertue of their my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p n="3">3. The inſtrumental Cauſe of it, ſhall be the ſound of a Trumpet: <hi>For the Trumpet ſhall blow, and the dead ſhall be raiſed,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 52. <hi>The Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voyce of the Archangel, and with the Trump of God, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 16. And though we cannot fully underſtand what kind of Trumpet this ſhall be, yet we may well conceive that it ſhall be an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary one, ſuch as hath not been, nor ſhall be heard of any until then, when the voyce thereof ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken all the dead throughout the world from their late and long ſleep.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The final Cauſe of it, ſhall be principally the Glory of God, that he may glorifie his Mercy upon ſome, and his Juſtice upon others, after their Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: And ſecondarily, <hi>that all the raiſed may receive according to the things done in their bodies, whether they ſhall be good or evil,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, It informeth us, That the laſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <note place="margin">7 <hi>Informat.</hi>
                  </note> ſhall be upon one and the ſame day with the ſecond Coming of Chriſt, as appears, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16. and for this cauſe it is ſaid, That <hi>the dead ſhall riſe and be raiſed at the laſt day,</hi> Joh. 6. 39, 40, 54. and 11. 24. where the day of Chriſts ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is called <hi>the laſt day,</hi> not abſolutely, but reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively (as I conceive,) becauſe it ſhall be the firſt and laſt day of that nature and kind: And though <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.</note> we know not this day, as we know other days, by way of computation, from the beginning; yet
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93010:60"/> we muſt know it to be the laſt day, in the former ſence.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, It informeth us, That the laſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <note place="margin">8 <hi>Informat.</hi>
                  </note> ſhall produce a great change in or upon the bodies of men, women and children: For though in this Reſurrection, of which I ſpeak, our bodies ſhall be the ſame with theſe, 1. For Eſſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatſoever is eſſential to theſe ſhall be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to them, as head and ears, eyes, hands and feet, &amp;c. 2. For Propriety, becauſe every one ſhall receive his own body again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. as God ſhall give unto every dead ſeed its own body; and ſo we ſhall ſee Chriſt not with other, but with theſe ſame eyes, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 27. Yet in the laſt Reſurrection our bodies ſhall not be the ſame with theſe, either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Subſtance, becauſe the ſubſtance of theſe ſhall periſh, and be brought to duſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. and the ſubſtance of thoſe ſhall be formed and raiſed, as is probable, out of the duſt of theſe, not out of the ſubſtance of them. Indeed thoſe bodies of men which have been tranſlated without death, and thoſe bodies of men which ſhall be changed without death, probably ſhall have the ſame ſubſtance in the World to come which now they have: But I ſpeak here of the dead bodies of men, and do not think that they ſhall be the ſame for ſubſtance with theſe which now we have, for the Reaſon before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither ſhall our bodies in the laſt Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be the ſame with theſe for Qualities; becauſe they ſhall be changed in this reſpect: For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe bodies are corruptible; thoſe ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible.</p>

               <p>And thus the laſt Reſurrection ſhall produce a great change in or upon the bodies of dead men and women.</p>
               <p>Being thus informed touching the laſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, we ſhould be admoniſhed from hence to beware of all erroneous opinions, in reference to this Subject: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If any think there ſhall be no ſuch Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> as the Sadduces thought, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 23. as ſome Philoſophers, <hi>Epicureans</hi> and <hi>Stoicks,</hi> thought, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 18. and as ſome amongſt the <hi>Corinthians</hi> thought, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. This is an erroneous opinion, contrary to the Informations before given; and we ſhould beware of it, becauſe they who thus think are not much better then <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> but are much worſe then ſome <hi>Pagans</hi> in former times, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Reſurrection of the dead, and an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life after death.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THree of the firſt things which ſhall be made vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the World to come, are, <hi>the ſecond Coming of Christ in the Fleſh, the last Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>the last Iudgment.</hi> And having ſpoken of two of theſe before, I am now to ſpeak of the third in this Section: And here, for the better informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our judgments, I ſhall affirm divers things alſo touching the laſt Judgment. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, I affirm, <hi>That the laſt Iudgment it to be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Inform.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>distinguiſhed from all other judgments, whether of God, or of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be diſtinguiſhed from all other Judgments of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe all other Judgments of God are but ſome National, or ſome particular ones, ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſome whole Nations, or ſuch as concern ſome particular perſons: But the laſt Judgment ſhall be more then ſome National or particular one, becauſe it ſhall be univerſal, ſuch as ſhall concern all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Mankinde, of all Nations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe all other Judgments of God are paſſed upon men at ſeveral times; for <hi>ſome mens ſins are open before-hand, going before to judgment, and ſome mens follow after,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 24. But the laſt Judgment ſhall be paſſed upon men all at once.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:93010:63"/> 3. Becauſe all other Judgments of God are but partial and gradual, not according the full meaſure of their works; but the laſt Judgment ſhall be full and compleat.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe all other Judgments of God are but temporal, whereas the laſt ſhall be eternal, in reſpect of the execution thereof.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe all other Judgments of God have in them ſomething that is ſecret and hid from men; but the laſt Judgment, with the cauſe of it, ſhall be fully and clearly revealed to men.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be diſtinguiſhed from all judgments of men, that are given and paſſed by men in this life.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſuch judgments of men are, in ſome things, commonly peccant, and faulty, like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but the laſt Judgment ſhall not be peccant or faulty in any thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe ſuch Judgments of men may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed from unto the Judgment of God at leaſt; but the laſt Judgment will admit of no appeal: and ſo the laſt Judgment is to be diſtinguiſhed from all other Judgments, whether of God, or of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I affirm, <hi>That the last Iudgment</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Inform.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>ſhall certainly be, and come to paſs in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we ſhould not doubt of it, becauſe God hath made the laſt Judgment ſure unto us by three things: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead: And one end for which God raiſed him from the dead, was, that thereby he might aſſure us of the laſt Judgment: <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By his Decree and Appointment: <hi>For it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:93010:63"/> 
                  <hi>unto men once to dye, but after this the Iudgment, Hebr.</hi> 9. 27. <hi>And God hath appointed a day, in which he will judg the world, Act.</hi> 17. 31. Now matters decreed and appointed by <hi>God,</hi> ſhall certainly be, and come to paſs in due ſeaſon: But the laſt Judgment is a matter decreed and appointed by <hi>God;</hi> therefore it ſhall certainly be, and come to paſs in due ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By plain Teſtimonies of Scripture, ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be evaded: For <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh plainly of the laſt Judgment, when he ſaith, <hi>The ungodly ſhall not ſtand in the Iudgment, Pſal.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>God ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Iudgment unto the people in uprightneſs, Pſal.</hi> 9. 8. <hi>He ſhall call to the Heavens from above, and to the Earth, that he may judg his people, Pſal.</hi> 50. 4. So doth <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>God ſhall judg the righteous and the wicked, Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>For all theſe things God ſhall bring thee to judgment, Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 9. <hi>And God ſhall bring every work to judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or evil, Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 14. So doth our <hi>Saviour,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>That he ſhall execute judgment as the Son of man, Ioh.</hi> 5. 27. So doth Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>We know the judgment of God ſhall be according to truth, againſt them that do ſuch things, Rom.</hi> 2. 2. So doth Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>There ſhall be judgment mercileſs unto them that ſhew no mercy, and mercy rejoyceth againſt judgment, Iames</hi> 2. 13. And ſo doth Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ſpeaketh of the <hi>Iudgment of the great day,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. Wherefore ſeeing the laſt Judgment is thus made ſure unto us by theſe things, we ſhould not doubt thereof, but ſhould beleeve that it ſhall certainly be, and come to paſs in due ſeaſon.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:93010:64"/>
               <p> Thirdly, I affirm, <hi>That the last Iudgment ſhall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3 <hi>Informat</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>be viſibly administred onely by Christ, as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as God and Man in one perſon.</hi> Indeed, I grant that this Judgment ſhall be efficiently cauſed by the whole Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſaid, <hi>That God ſhall judg the world, Pſa.</hi> 50. 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 75. 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31. And the outward acts of the <hi>Godhead</hi> are common to all three perſons in the <hi>Godhead.</hi> I grant alſo, that this Judgment ſhall be inſtrumentally cauſed by the holy Angels, becauſe they ſhall go forth, and <hi>gather together Gods Elect from the four winds of the Earth, viz.</hi> unto Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 31. They ſhall ſever, or ſeparate, the good from the bad before the ſentence of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be given, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 49. And I grant, that this Judgment ſhall be atteſted, and approved of, by all the Saints of <hi>God:</hi> In which ſence it is ſaid, <hi>That the Saints ſhall judg the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. And <hi>the Apoſtles ſhall ſit upon Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael, Mat.</hi> 19. 28.</p>
               <p>Yet we muſt know, that this Judgment ſhall be viſibly adminiſtred onely by Chriſt, as Mediator, and as God and Man in one perſon, and by no other perſon: In which ſence it is ſaid, <hi>The Father judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son, Joh.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>God will judg the world by the man whom he hath ordained,</hi> that is, <hi>by Christ, Act.</hi> 17. 31. <hi>He will judg the ſecrets of men by Ieſus Christ, Rom.</hi> 2. 16. And <hi>Chriſt is ordained of God to be Iudg of quick and dead, Act.</hi> 10. 42. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>And this (without doubt) will be a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to <hi>Gods</hi> Elect at the day of Judgment, when they ſhall conſider that they ſhall have none to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93010:64"/> pronounce Judgment upon them at that day, but Chriſt their Saviour, who dyed for their ſins, and roſe again for their Juſtification: As on the other ſide, it will be a great terror to reprobate ſinners, when they ſhall conſider that they ſhall have none pronounce Judgment upon them, but Chriſt, whom they have always contemned and deſpiſed; if not in his perſon, yet in his Ordinances, and in his Members: and whom they would not have to reign over them in this world by his Word and Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I affirm, <hi>That the laſt judgment ſhall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4 <hi>Inform.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>extend unto all reaſonable Creatures, both Angels and men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſhall extend to the Angels, both good and evil: For Chriſt is the Lord of the good Angels, and their office is to worſhip him as their Lord, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall judg them at the latter day, not for any evil they have done, becauſe they have done none; but according to the good they have done, becauſe they have been always ready to worſhip him, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his voyce, and to do his Will. And he ſhall judg the evil Angels, or Devils, for their firſt fall, and for all the evils they have acted ſince; For <hi>they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in everlasting chains under darkneſs, unto the judgment of the great day, Jude</hi> 6. And h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Judgment upon them ſhall be approved of by the Saints; <hi>Know ye not that we ſhall judg the Angels?</hi> that is, the evil Angels: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 3.</p>
               <p>This Judgment alſo ſhall extend unto all men, women, and children. For this cauſe it is ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt ſhall judg the righteous and the wicked;</hi> that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, ſuch as ſhall be found righteous, or wicked, at that day; <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>And he ſhall judg the quick</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:93010:65"/> 
                  <hi>and the dead, Act.</hi> 10. 42. that is, ſuch as ſhall be found alive, at his ſecond Coming; and ſuch as ſhall be found, dead at that day, ſhall be raiſed, and brought to Judgment: And <hi>he ſhall judg the ſmall and the great, Revel.</hi> 20. 13. <hi>all the ungodly, Jude</hi> 15: yea <hi>all ſhall ſtand before him, Rom.</hi> 14. 10. Therefore all men ſhall be judged by him.</p>
               <p>Yet we muſt underſtand, That he ſhall judg men in a different way at that day: For he ſhall judg the Elect, as righteous perſons, with the Judgment of Abſolution; but he ſhall judg the Reprobates, as wicked perſons, with the Judgment of Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: And he ſhall judg the Elect and Righteous according to the good they have done, forgetting their evil works; but he ſhall judg the Reprobates and wicked according to the evil they have done, not regarding their ſeeing good works.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I affirm, <hi>That the laſt Judgment ſhall be just and righteous altogether.</hi> For which cauſe <note place="margin">5 <hi>Inform.</hi>
                  </note> it is ſaid, <hi>That God ſhall judg the world in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, in uprightneſs, in truth, Pſal.</hi> 9. 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 2. And if he ſhall thus judg the world at the laſt, then the laſt Judgment ſhall be juſt and righteous altogether.</p>
               <p>Yea, all the proceedings of this Judgment ſhall be juſt, as may be ſeen in theſe particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. There ſhall be a Throne, or ſeat, prepared for Judgment: For <hi>God hath prepared his Throne for judgment, Pſal.</hi> 9. 7. And will not this be juſt, That a Throne ſhall be prepared before Judgment ſhall be pronounced on any?</p>
               <p n="2">2. There ſhall be a ſummons to Judgment, to this effect; <hi>Ariſe ye dead, and come to judgment.</hi> And will not this be juſt, That there ſhall be a

               <p n="3">3. There ſhall be <hi>a perſonal appearance of all men made before the Iudgment ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. And will not this be juſt, That there ſhall be a perſonal appearance of all before Judgment ſhall be pronounced upon any?</p>
               <p n="4">4. There ſhall be a cauſe produced for this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> the righteouſneſs of the Juſt, and the wickedneſs of the unjuſt: <hi>For God ſhall bring eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work to judgment, with every ſecret thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or evil, Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 14. And will not this be juſt, That there ſhall be a cauſe produced before the Judgment ſhall be pronounced upon any?</p>
               <p n="5">5. There ſhall be evidence brought in on both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

What Books? Theſe: 1. The book of <hi>Gods Omniſcience.</hi> 2. The book of <hi>every mans Conſcience.</hi> 3. The book of <hi>the Law, Iames</hi> 2. 12. 4.

Theſe books ſhall be opened, and in them ſhall be found written whatſoever ſhall make for acquitting of the Juſt, and the condemning of the unjuſt: And they ſhall be judged according to that which ſhall be found written in theſe books.

               <p n="6">6. There ſhall be (after all this) a Sentence of

               <p>The Sentence that ſhall be given and pronounced upon the Elect, under the name and notion of juſt perſons, ſhall be to this effect; <hi>Come ye bleſſed Children of my Father, receive the Kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you from the beginning of the world.</hi> And the reaſon of this Sentence ſhall be added, thus; <hi>For I was hungry, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink; I was naked, and ye clothed me; I was ſick, and in priſon, and ye came unto me: And in as much as ye have done it to one of theſe little ones which beleeve in me, ye have done it unto me: Mat.</hi> 25. 34. 40.</p>
               <p>The Sentence alſo which ſhall be given and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon the Reprobates, under the name and notion of unjuſt perſons, ſhall be to this effect; <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> And the reaſon of this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence alſo ſhall be added, thus: <hi>For I was hungry, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; ſick, and in priſon, and ye viſited me not.

               <p>As, 1. That this Judgment ſhall be upon one and the ſame day with the ſecond Coming of Chriſt: And for this cauſe the day of his ſecond Coming is called, <hi>the day of Iudgment, Mat.</hi> 10. 15. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Iude</hi> 6. And here it ſhould be remembred, that the day of Judgment is taken and uſed in a double ſence: 1. For the day of Sentence; As when it is ſaid, that <hi>every idle word that men ſpeak, they ſhall give account thereof in the day of Judgment, Mat.</hi> 12. 36. 2. For the day of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; As when it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the unjuſt to the day of Judgment to be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. Now when I ſay that the day of Judgment ſhall be the ſame with the day of Chriſts ſecond Coming, we muſt underſtand it of the day of Sentence, not of the day of Execution, becauſe the day of Execution ſhall continue after the day of his ſecond Coming.</p>
               <p>2. It teacheth us, That the time of the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould not be thought to be far off, becauſe Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Behold the Iudg</hi> (meaning Chriſt) <hi>ſtandeth before the door, Iam.</hi> 5. 9. which expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is taken from an earthly Judg, who when he ſtandeth before the door, ſhould not be thought to be far of, but neer at hand; neither ſhould his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be thought to be far of, but neer at hand: but Chriſt our Judg <hi>ſtandeth before the door</hi> (ſaith he,) therefore we ſhould not think him to be far off, but neer at hand; neither ſhould we think this

Whence I gather, That Chriſt at his ſecond appearing ſhall have a humane Kingdom, ſuch as now he hath not; and that where this Kingdom ſhall be, there ſhall the laſt Judgment be: But this Kingdom of his ſhall be in the World to come, as I ſhall have occaſion to prove hereafter; therefore this Judgment of his ſhall be in the World to come.</p>

And ſo from this place we may better prove, that this laſt Judgment ſhall be in the World to come, then that it ſhall be in the Ayr that now is: And withall I add, That thoſe Divines which have taken much pains to deſcribe Chriſts Throne in the Ayr that now is, might well have ſaved that labor.</p>

And what elſe can befall them both, after the Sentence of this Iudgment, but the Execution thereof?

               <p n="1">1. The Eſſential Kingdom of Chriſt is that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which belongs to him as he is God equal with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt; for whatſoever is common to the three perſons in the Trinity is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to each of them, as the Godhead is common to all, and eſſential to each of them; Omniſciency is common to all, and eſſential to each of them; Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency is common to all, and eſſential to each of them: So there is a Kingdom common to all of them, which therefore may be called, the eſſential Kingdom of Chriſt, as he is God equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Holy Ghoſt; which Kingdom of his is called by ſome, His Natural Kingdom; by others, His Native or Providential Kingdom; by me, His Eſſential Kingdom: And this Kingdom of his hath for its Object both this world and the World to come: It is every where, in Heaven, in Earth, and under the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               <p n="2">2. The Perſonal-Divine Kingdom of Chriſt is that Kingdom which belongs unto him, as he is God and man in one Perſon, and wherein he now raigns in his Divine Nature: For it is commonly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Divines, That Chriſt now raigneth over his Militant Church in his Divine Nature, and hath ſo raigned from the beginning hitherto, and ſhall ſo raign unto the end of the world in a ſpiritual way, and that both inwardly, by his Word and Spirit, and outwardly, by the Diſcipline and Government which he hath appointed in his Church: And they ſay, The Perſon which thus raigns is God and man, yet the Nature wherein he raigns is not the Humane, but the Divine Nature; and therefore I call it his Perſonal-Divine Kingdom. Of this Kingdom of his it is ſaid, <hi>The Kingdom of God is at hand,</hi> Mar. 1. 15. <hi>The Kingdom of God cometh not with obſervation: The Kingdom of God is within you,</hi> Luk. 17. 20, 21. <hi>The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14. 17. And I acknowledg, that this Kingdom of his may fitly be called his Spiritual Kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Government in it is altogether Spiritual: It may fitly be called his Donative Kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he received it by donation and gift from his
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93010:72"/> Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 2. It may fitly be called his Mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Kingdom, becauſe it belongs unto him as he is a Mediator between God and man: And it may fitly be called his Oeconomical Kingdom, becauſe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends properly to his Family, the viſible Church: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I think, that think this Perſonal Kingdom of Chriſt, conſidered as meerly Divine, ſhall extend to the Church Triumphant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Perſonal-Humane Kingdom of Chriſt is that Kingdom which belongs unto him, as he is the Son of man, and the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and wherein he ſhall raign in his Humane Nature, bodily and viſibly. And though I grant, That this Kingdom of his ſhall be a ſecond eſtate of his Perſonal, Donative, Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Occonomical Kingdom: yet for diſtinction ſake I call it his Perſonal-Humane Kingdom, becauſe only in this eſtate of his Kingdom ſhall he raign after a bodily and humane manner.</p>
               <p>Now this is the Kingdom of which I am here to ſpeak, and I ſhall ſpeak of it, partly by way of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and partly by way of Uſe and Application.</p>
               <p>By way of Doctrine, I ſhall lay down ſeveral prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or grounds needful to be known concerning this Kingdom of Chriſt: As,</p>

                  <hi>a Perſonal-Humane Kingdom, wherein he ſhall raign bodily in his Humane Nature.</hi> as we may well conceive;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe he ſhall one day have a Kingdom, wherein he <hi>ſhall judg the quick and the dead,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. But he ſhall never judg the quick and the dead in his preſent Perſonal-Spiritual Kingdom: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall one day have a Perſonal-Humane King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, wherein he ſhall do this.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:93010:72"/> 2. Becauſe he ſhall one day have a Kingdom, wherein ſome ſhall ſit at his right hand, and others at his left hand, as is acknowledged, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 21, 23. But none shall ſit on his right hand, and on his left, in his preſent Perſonal-Spiritual Divine Kingdom: Therefore he shall one day have a Perſonal-Humane Kingdom, wherein ſome shall ſit on his right hand, and ſome on his left.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe he shall one day have a Kingdom, wherein ſome shall eat and drink at his table, after a new manner, yet unknown; as it is acknowledged, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 30. <hi>Ye ſhall eat and drink at my tabl, in my Kingdom:</hi> But none shall eat and drink at his table after a new manner and way, yet unknown, in his preſent Perſonal-Spiritual Kingdom: Therefore he shall one day have a Perſonal-Humane Kingdom, wherein this shall be done.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe Chriſt was long ſince anointed to be a Prophet, a Prieſt, and a King, not only in his Divine but alſo in his Humane Nature: And we know, that in the days of his flesh he executed his Prophetical and Prieſtly Offices, not only in his Divine, but alſo in his Humane Nature, though he did not then ſo execute his Kingly Office: Therefore doubtleſs he shall one day execute his Kingly Office alſo in his Humane Nature, and ſo he shall one day have a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal-Humane Kingdom.</p>
               <p>This ground should firmly be held againſt ſuch as think that Chriſt shall never have a Perſonal-Humane Kingdom, but ſay, That the Perſonal Kingdom of Chriſt is and ever shall be, only a Spiritual Kingdom. And though I do not read much, yet I have read two or three Books printed of late years, which ſpeak much of the Perſonal Raign or Kingdom of Chriſt:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93010:73"/> but what they ſpeak, they refer only to his Spiritual Kingdom, and nothing at all to his Perſonal-Humane Kingdom. Now all that I ſhall ſay of theſe Writers is this; I will not diſhonour them ſo much as to name them it my margin; neither do I think that they have as yet ſeriouſly conſidered of ſuch Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as are here alledged, and might be farther al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, for the Perſonal-Humane Kingdom of Chriſt: but if at any time they ſhall ſeriouſly conſider of them, I perſwade my ſelf they will be of another mind.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I affirm, <hi>That Chriſts Perſonal-Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>

                  <hi>Kingdom ſhall never be found to be of, in, or belonging to this perſent world.</hi> And ſo much I gather from thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this world, if my Kingdom were of this world, then would my ſervants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered unto the Jews, but now is my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom not from hence,</hi> Ioh. 18. 36. where our Saviour ſpeaks not of his Eſſential Kingdom, nor of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Perſonal-Divine Kingdom, becauſe both theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this preſent world, as wel as to any other: But he ſpeaks of his Perſonal-Humane Kingdom, which belongs not to this world in any reſpect: For they that have humane Kingdoms in this world have ſome to fight for them againſt their enemies; but Chriſt, while he was in this world, had no ſervants to fight for him againſt the <hi>Jews:</hi> Therefore his Perſonal-Humane Kingdom belongs not to this preſent world. Again, we know, that while Chriſt lived in this world he had no Humane Kingdom of it, but he ſtill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ppeared in the form and condition of a Servant, not in the form and condition of a humane King, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>herefore we may well think, that he ſhall never be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93010:73"/> a humane King, nor have a humane Kingdom in this world. Moreover, we know, that Chriſt ſhall not come again in his Humane Nature before this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world ſhall be diſſolved, and an other world ſhall be created inſtead hereof: And if Chriſt ſhall not come again in his Humane Nature till then, it is manifeſt, <hi>That his Perſonal-Humane Kingdom ſhall never be found to be of, in, or belonging to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ground alſo ſhould be firmly held againſt ſuch as think, that Chriſt ſhall have a Perſonal-Humane Kingdom in this world; which is the opinion of many Millenaries in theſe days: For though ſome of this ſort are come on to this Error, to think that Chriſts Perſonal Kingdom ſhall be only a Spiritual Kingdom; yet the moſt part of this ſort think that Chriſt shall have a Perſonal-Humane Kingdom in this world, either for a thouſand years, or at leaſt for a certain time. And they which are of this opinion are forced to hold ſome other erroneous opinions; as, 1. That Chriſt shall come again in his Humane Nature a thouſand years before the end of this world. 2. That he shall convert all Nations, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that he may raign over them at his Coming. 3. That he shall raiſe the dead Saints a thouſand years before the reſt of the dead, that they may raign with him. Thus one Error con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, genders many. But our Saviour himſelf hath ſufficiently confuted theſe Opinioniſts in one ſaying, when ſpeaking of his Humane Kingdom, he ſaith, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world:</hi> How then can they prove, that Chriſt shall have a Humane Kingdom in this world? And if they would but conſider farther what hath been ſaid for the clearing
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93010:74"/> of this ſecond ground, it may be that they might be be the better convinced of their Error.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I affirm, <hi>That this Perſonal-Humane</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3 <hi>Ground.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Kingdom of his ſhall be very viſible and apparent unto men in the World to come.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Seeing there is ſuch a Kingdom belonging to him, it muſt needs be apparent to men, either in this world, or in the World to come: but it ſhall not be apparent to men in this world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 36. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall be apparent unto them in the World to come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We find, that the World to come ſhall be put in ſubjection not to the Angels, but to Chriſt, as the Son of man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5, 6. And if ſo, then doubtleſs his Humane Kingdom ſhall be very viſible and apparent unto men in the World to come.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Hereafter ye ſhall ſee Heaven open, and the Angels of God aſcending and deſcending upon the Son of man,</hi> Ioh. 1. 51. Hereafter we ſhall ſee this: and where ſhall we ſee it? not in the higheſt Heaven which now is, there is no ſuch thing to be ſeen; not in this preſent world, here is no ſuch thing to be ſeen: but in the World to come we ſhall ſee this Kingly Honour given to Chriſt; and ſo his Perſonal-Humane Kingdom ſhall be very apparent to men in the World to come.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is plainly ſaid, That <hi>every eye ſhall ſee Chriſt, in his Humane Nature, ſitting upon the Throne of his Glory, Rev.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 31. And ſome <hi>ſhall ſay unto the Mountains and Rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth upon the Throne,</hi> Rev. 6. 16. And where ſhall this be, but in the World to come? Wherefore from theſe premiſes I infer, <hi>That the Perſonal-Humane</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:93010:74"/> 
                  <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall be very viſible and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent unto men in the World to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this Ground ſhould be firmly held againſt ſuch as think that Chriſt ſhall have no Perſonal-Humane Kingdom in the World to come, becauſe it's ſaid, That at or upon the end of this world <hi>he ſhall deliver up the Kingdom to God even the Father,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 24. But as I have intimated before upon an other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo now I ſay more fully, That Chriſt ſhal never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up his own Kingdom to God even the Father, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his own Eſſential Kingdom, or his own Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Kingdom: For if he ſhould deliver and reſign his own Eſſential Kingdom, then he ſhould ceaſe to be an Eſſential King, which would be abſurd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg: And if he ſhall reſign his Perſonal, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, or Humane Kingdom to God even the Father, then he ſhall ceaſe to be a Perſonal King, or elſe the Perſonal Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall become the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Kingdom of the Father; both which would be alſo abſurd to affirm: Therefore the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this place is, That when Chriſt ſhall come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from the third Heaven (his Fathers Perſonal Kingdom) in his Humane Nature, he ſhall then reſign and deliver up this Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> his Fathers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Kingdom (not his own Perſonal Kingdom) to God even the Father, that his Father may be all in all in it, as he was before Chriſt came thither in his Humane Nature. And ſo this place, rightly underſtood, makes nothing at all againſt this third Ground.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I affirm, <hi>That this Perſonal-Humane</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4 <hi>Ground.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Kingdom of his, belonging to the World to come, is much ſpoken of in the Scriptures, both in the Old and New Teſtaments.</hi>

               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:93010:75"/>
               <p> It is much ſpoken of in the Old Teſtament; for therein the Father hath ſaid unto Chriſt, <hi>I ſhall give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt parts of the Earth for thy poſſeſſion: Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of iron, thou ſhalt daſh them in peeces like a Potters veſſel,</hi> Pſal. 2. 8, 9. And where shall this promiſe be fully made good unto him? not in this world, but in the World to come, and in his Humane Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Therein it is ſaid concerning Chriſt, That <hi>he ſhall raign over the Nations, and ſhall judg the Earth,</hi> 1 Chron. 16. 31, 33. And where shall this promiſe be fully made good unto him? not in this world, but in the World to come, and in his Humane Kingdom, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
               <p>Therein it is ſaid concerning him, That <hi>he ſhall have Dominion over the works of Gods hands, and all things ſhall be put under his feet; all Sheep and Oxen; yea, and the beasts of the field, the fowl of the ayr, and the fiſh of the ſea, and whatſoever paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through the paths of the ſeas,</hi> Pſal. 8. 6, 7, 8.

               <p>Therein we find him deſcribed as a Humane King, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. throughout, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. and in many other places. But where shall he appear as a humane King? not in this world, but in the World to come, where he shall have ſuch a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Therein it is ſaid concerning him, That <hi>of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his Government there ſhall be no end, upon the Throne of David, and upon his Kingdom, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and to establiſh it with Judgment and Iuſtice, Iſai.</hi> 9. 7. And where shall this promiſe be fully

               <p>Therein it is ſaid concerning him, <hi>David my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhall be King over them, and they ſhall all have one Shepherd, they ſhall alſo walk in my Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and obſerve my Statutes, and do them: And David ſhall be their Prince for ever,</hi> Ezek. 37. 24, 25. And where shall this be fully made good unto him? not in this world, but in the World to come, and in his Humane Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Therein it is ſaid concerning him, That <hi>there was given him Dominion, and Glory, and a Kingdom, that all People, Nations and Languages ſhould ſerve him,</hi> Dan. 7. 14.

               <p>It is alſo much ſpoken of in the New Teſtament: For herein we find, That <hi>the Lord God ſhall give unto Chriſt the Throne of his Father David,</hi> Luk. 1. 32. And where shall he fully receive this gift? not in this world, but in the World to come; for <hi>the Throne of David</hi> was not a Type of Chriſts Spiritual Kingdom, but of his Humane Kingdom in the World to come.</p>
               <p>Herein alſo we find, That ſome <hi>ſhall ſit at his right hand, and ſome at his left in his Kingdom,</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:93010:76"/> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 21. 23. And where ſhall this be fully ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of him? not in this world, but in the World to come, and in his Humane Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And when the penitent thief ſaid, <hi>Lord, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me when thou comest into thy Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 23. 42.

               <p>And luſtly, Whereas upon the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet this ſaying ſhall be ecchoed forth, <hi>The Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt, &amp;c,</hi> Rev. 11. 15. I do not think that this ſaying ſhall ever be fulfilled at the utmoſt in this world, but in the World to come: And doubleſs after the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world ſhall be diſſolved, and broken in peeces, as they ſhall be with the diſſolution of this preſent world, then immediately ſhall they be reſolved into <hi>the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt,</hi> and ſhall be brought wholy in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, and not before. Wherefore I infer, <hi>That the Perſonal-Humane Kingdom of Christ is much ſpoken in the Scriptures, both of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament:</hi> And conſequently we ſhould not doubt, whether or not he ſhall have ſuch a Kingdom.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For, 1. It ſhall extend to all Nations that ſhall be in the World to come: As it is written of Chriſt, <hi>All Kings ſhall bow before him all Nations ſhall ſerve him,</hi> Pſal. 72. 11. <hi>All Nations, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and People, ſhall ſerve him,</hi> Dan 7. 14. which ſhall never be fully accompliſhed in this world; as we may well think, becauſe at his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Coming he ſhall find <hi>the Nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, gathered together to battel againſt him and againſt his Saints, the number of whom ſhall be as the ſand of the Sea,</hi> Rev. 20. 8, 9. Therefore it is in the World to Come that all Nations ſhall ſerve him.</p>
               <p>2. It ſhall extend to all Countries that ſhall be in the World to come; as it is written, <hi>His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mion ſhall be from Sea to Sea, and from the River unto the ends of the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 72. 8.</p>

               <p>4.

               <p>5. Yea, it ſhall extend unto the whole World to come, ſeeing it ſhall be put in ſubjection to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5. And ſo this Kingdom of his shall be of large extent.</p>

                  </note> ſome Writers, That this Perſonal-Humane-Divine Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall one day have an end, or that it ſhall continue but onely for a long time; becauſe, as they ſay, ſome things are ſaid in Scripture to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever, which were to continue but onely for a long time: But we ſhould underſtand, that theſe phraſes, <hi>for ever, for ever and ever,</hi> are taken two
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93010:78"/> ways in Scripture: Sometimes Tropically, and not properly; and then indeed they are referred to ſuch things as were to continue but only for a long time; as may be ſeen, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 14, 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21. 6. <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 15. Sometimes alſo the ſame phraſes are taken properly, and not Tropically; and then they are ſtill referred to ſuch things as have no end at all. Yea, thus theſe phraſes, <hi>for ever, for ever and ever,</hi> are taken in the former paſſages, concerning the Perſonal Humane Kingdom of Chriſt; and ſo the meaning of them is, That this Kingdom of his ſhall have no end at all: And it is plainly ſaid in ſome of thoſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges once and again, <hi>That this Kingdon of his ſhall have no end, Iſai.</hi> 9. 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 33. By which latter phraſe we muſt expound the two former, that we may not conſent to the blaſphemy of thoſe who ſay, <hi>That the Perſonal Kingdom of Chriſt, whether Divine, or Humane, ſhall continue but onely for a time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much of this Kingdom of Chriſt, by way <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> of Doctrine, in ſeven Grounds or Propoſitions. I ſhal alſo ſpeak ſomething by way of Application, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my promiſe. And,</p>
               <p>Firſt, This Doctrine ſhould admoniſh all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, leſt we entertain any erroneous Opinions in our mindes, in reference to this Kingdom of his. And far be it from us to think:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That Chriſts perſonal Kingdom ſhall be onely a ſpiritual Kingdom.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That Chriſt ſhall have a perſonal humane Kingdom in this world.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>That he ſhall have no perſonal humane King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the World to come.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>That his perſonal humane Kingdom ſhal have an end.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:93010:78"/>
               <p> For all theſe Opinions are contrary to the former Grounds, and to the Truth it ſelf: Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Doctrine ſhould humble all ſuch as are enemies to Chriſts ſpiritual perſonal Kingdom in this world, and will not ſubmit unto it, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to reign over them by his Word and Spirit. Surely ſuch perſons, without repentance, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a pardon, ſhall ſuffer for it, when Chriſt ſhall come into his perſonal humane Kingdom. And ſo much we may gather from the Prophets comminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. For there he tells us of ſome that did <hi>rage, and imagine a vain thing, and band them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, not onely againſt the Lord, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Chriſt; but alſo againſt the Laws of his ſpiritual Kingdom,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Let us break their bands in ſunder, and caſt away their cords from us:</hi> Verſ. 1, 2, 3. And ſhews withall how Chriſt ſhall deal with ſuch (unleſs they repent) in his perſonal humane Kingdom; <hi>viz.</hi> how <hi>he ſhall break them with a rod of iron, and daſh them in peeces like a Potters veſſel,</hi> Verſ. 9. Yea, our Saviour himſelf ſheweth us how he will punish men in his perſonal humane Kingdom, if they will not ſubmit unto him in his perſonal ſpiritual Kingdom, when he ſaith, <hi>But thoſe mine Enemies, which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me, Luk.</hi> 19. 27. Be humbled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for this offence, which is a great offence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This Doctrine should exhort and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade all that are called Chriſtians unto ſundry du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To talk and confer much about this Kingdom of Chriſt, that ſo they may rightly underſtand the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93010:79"/> doctrine, nature, and ſtate hereof; for it is ſaid of Gods Saints, <hi>That they ſhall ſpeak of the glory of his Kingdom, and talk of his power; to make known to the ſons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majeſty of his Kingdom: Pſal.</hi> 145. 11, 12. And we should be like unto ſuch, in doing the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To honor Chriſt as our everlaſting King: For God would have <hi>all men to honour the Son, as they honor the Father:</hi> And ſeeing he is and shall be our King for ever, we can do no leſs then honor him; and we should honor him ſo, as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To harken to the Doctrine of his Kingdom: <hi>Harken O Daughter, and conſider, and incline thine ear: Pſal.</hi> 45. 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To prefer him in our eſteem before all the ſons of men: as the Prophet ſaith to the Church, in reference to this Kingdom of his; <hi>Forget alſo thine own people, and thy fathers houſe; ſo ſhall the King greatly deſire thy beauty: Pſal.</hi> 45. 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To repent of our ſins and offences: For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, having ſpoken of his Kingdom, doth thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on exhort to repentance, ſaying, <hi>Be wiſe now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O ye Kings; be learned, ye that are Judges of the Earth: Pſal.</hi> 2. 10. As if he had ſaid, <hi>Be wiſe to eſchew evil, and be learned to do good:</hi> In which two things conſiſteth the practice of true repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To worship him with Fear: As it is ſaid, in relation to Chriſt; <hi>He is thy Lord God, worſhip thou him, Pſal.</hi> 45. 11. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling, Pſal.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Who ſhall not fear thee O Lord? Rev.</hi> 15. 4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To ſubmit to his Government in this life: And
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93010:79"/> this is, in the Prophets phraſe, <hi>To kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry, and we periſh: Pſal.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To beleeve and truſt in him for all good things promiſed: And upon this occaſion the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are all they that truſt in him: Pſal.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To be diligent in our general and particular Callings, that we may become profitable ſervants in them: For when Chriſt shall come into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his, he shall plentifully reward his diligent and profitable ſervants, and shall ſay unto one, <hi>Be thou Ruler over ten Cities;</hi> and to another, <hi>Be thou Ruler over five Cities: Luk.</hi> 19. 17, 19.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To be patient in our Tribulations, eſpecially in ſuch as we shall ſuffer for Chriſts ſake: <hi>For if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him in his Kingdom:</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To make our Calling and Election ſure unto our ſelves: <hi>For ſo an enterance ſhall be miniſtred unto you abundantly, into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Cheiſt:</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, All good Chriſtians ſhould rejoyce, and be glad, when they hear and read of this Kingdom of Chriſt: Yea, we ſhould never think that we have well meditated and throughly conſidered of this ſubject, until the meditation thereof shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce our ſpirirs. And for this end and purpoſe we shall finde in many places of Scripture, where this Kingdom is ſpoken of, that we are called upon to rejoyce: As, <hi>Rejoyce with trembling, Pſal.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Let the Heavens rejoyce, and let the Earth be glad: Let the field be joyful before the Lord; for he cometh, for he cometh to judg the world in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:93010:80"/> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Let Iſrael rejoyce in him that made him; Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King, let them praiſe his name in the dance, let them ſing praiſes unto him with the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brel and Harp: Pſa.</hi> 149. 2, 3. <hi>The Lord God omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent reigneth, let us rejoyce and be glad, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made her ſelf ready: Rev.</hi> 19. 6, 7.</p>

               <p>HAving ſpoken of the Kingdom of Chriſt in the World to come; I ſhall here, in the next place, ſay ſomewhat of the different condition of good and evil Angels in the World to come.

                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:93010:80"/> 
                  <hi>from Heaven with his mighty Angels:</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they ſhall be ſerviceable to Chriſt about the laſt Judgment: For it is ſaid, <hi>That he ſhall ſend his Angels,</hi> that is, his good Angels, <hi>with a great ſound of a trumpet, and they ſhall gather together his Elect from the four winds, from one end of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the other: Matt.</hi> 24. 31. <hi>And that his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, viz.</hi> his good Angels, <hi>ſhall come forth, and ſever the wicked from among the juſt, and ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 13. 49, 50.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they ſhall have a conſtant intercourſe, or paſſage, between the third Heaven and the World to come, as royal Meſſengers or Embaſſadors from the Father to the Son of man, and from the Son of man to the Father; or from the perſonal Kingdom of the Father to the perſonal Kingdom of the Son; and from the perſonal humane Kingdom of the Son unto the perſonal Kingdom of the Father: And ſo much I learn from thoſe words of our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>Hereafter ye ſhall ſee Heaven open, and the Angels of God, viz.</hi> his good Angels, <hi>aſcending and deſcending upon the Son of man: John</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 51.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That as they are now bleſſed, ſo ſhall they be for ever bleſſed in the World to come: And by ſo much the more ſhall they be bleſſed in the World to come, by how much their Miniſtry and Service ſhall be more viſible to the Saints, and better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of them in the World to come, then now it is.</p>
               <p>Which condition of the good Angels may inform <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> us: Firſt, That the Humane Nature in Chriſt ſhall
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93010:81"/> in dignity far excel the good Angels in the World to come: For we are ſure that theſe Angels ſhall ſerve Chriſt, and adminiſter unto him; but we are not ſure that Chriſt ſhall ſerve them in the World to come. And we know that Chriſt is now for the preſent above theſe Angels, in his Humane Nature, at his Fathers right hand; and that he took not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the nature of Mankinde: and therefore he ſhall ſtill be above the Angels in his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And albeit, during the time of his Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was made a little lower then the Angels, that he might ſuffer in the fleſh: Yet now he is exalted above them, and ſhall be crowned with glory and dignity above them, in the World to come, for ever.</p>
               <p>Again, This condition of the good Angels in the World to come, may inform us; That the adopted Children of God have great cauſe to be thankful for the perſeverance of theſe Angels in the ſtate of grace, for that God hath kept them hitherto in their holy ſtation, that ſo they might be helpful to us by their Miniſtry, both in this world, and in the World to come. And though our fleſhly nature be not ſenſible of the Miniſtry of theſe Angels, yet we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, according to the Scriptures, That God doth make their Miniſtry beneficial to his adopted ones in this life divers ways.</p>
               <p>Sometimes for Inſtruction: as he ſent a good Angel to inſtruct the Shepherds concerning the birth of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. Another to inſtruct the women concerning his Reſurrection: Another to inſtruct his Diſciples touching his Aſcenſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
               <p>Sometimes for Direction: as he ſent a good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93010:81"/> to direct <hi>Lot</hi> what courſe to take for his own and his families ſafety.</p>
               <p>Sometimes for Protection: as it is written, <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth about them that fear him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes for Deliverance: as he ſent a good Angel to deliver <hi>Peter</hi> out of priſon, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Sometimes for Conſolation: as when the Devil had ended his temptation againſt Chriſt, he ſent good Angels to adminiſter comfort unto him: <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Now if we conſider what excellent Creatures theſe good Angels are, and how glorious they ſhall be in the World to come, we ſhall finde it a great mercy of God, that he hath made them <hi>miniſtring ſpirits, and hath ſent them to miniſter for the good of thoſe, who are heirs of Salvation, Hebr.</hi> 1. 14. And conſequently, that the adopted ones have great cauſe to be thankful for their Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning evil Angels, I beleeve,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That they ſhall be ſubject, not onely unto Chriſt himſelf, but alſo unto the Saints, in the World to come: And to aſſure us hereof, it is ſaid, <hi>That the Saints ſhall judg the Angels,</hi> that is, the evil Angels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>And that the God of peace ſhall bruiſe Satan under their feet ſhortly, Rom.</hi> 16. 20.

               <p n="3">3. That this everlaſting puniſhment of theirs ſhall be full of torment, as they themſelves well know; and therefore they cryed unto Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>What have we to do with thee, Jeſus thou Son of God?

Secondly, Becauſe God will bleſs them, though men curſe them never ſo much; as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Let them curſe, but bleſs thou Lord, Pſal.</hi> 109. 28. <hi>And God ſhall bleſs us, Pſal.</hi> 67. 7. Thirdly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God will curſe them that curſe his people, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3. Fourthly, Becauſe <hi>the curſe cauſleſs ſhall not come, Prov.</hi> 26. 2.

For theſe cauſes it is in vain for any to curſe Gods Elect in this life. VVherefore, my brethren, let us not curſe one another, as the manner of ſome is: let not Parents curſe their Children, nor Children their Parents; Maſters their Servants, nor Servants their Maſters; Husbands their VVives, nor VVives their Husbands; the Rich the Poor, nor the Poor the Rich, &amp;c. fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in ſo doing we may curſe Gods Elect unawares; and it will be in vain to curſe them. Nay, thoſe curſes, which we ſhoot as arrows againſt them, may recoyl upon our ſelves: as <hi>Balak</hi> and <hi>Balaam</hi> deſired to curſe the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but this became a curſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at laſt: So <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed <hi>David</hi> the Lords anointed; but this became a curſe upon himſelf at the laſt.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> Though it be not lawful to curſe <hi>Gods</hi> Elect, yet I hope it may be lawful to curſe wicked Reprobates?</p>

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> If we certainly knew Reprobates from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in this life, we might lawfully curſe them, as <hi>God</hi> doth and will curſe them: But this knowledg is too high for us; we cannot, without extraordinary revelation, know in particular who are Reprobates in this life: therefore we ought not to curſe any, as ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. Noah</hi> curſed his ſon <hi>Cam, Geneſ.</hi> 9. 25. and <hi>Eliſha</hi> curſed the two and fourty children that mocked him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 24. and why may not we do the like?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Theſe examples of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and are not recorded for our imitation:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93010:86"/> But concerning them I thus judg and conceive, That either <hi>Noah</hi> knew, by extraordinary revelation, his ſon <hi>Cam</hi> to be a Reprobate, and thereupon curſed him: or elſe, that he ſinned in this act: And ſo that <hi>Eliſha</hi> either knew, by extraordinary Revelation, thoſe two and fourty children to be Reprobates, and thereupon curſed them; or elſe, that he ſinned in this act.</p>
               <p>Now in theſe days we have no ſuch extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Revelations, but muſt walk by that ordinary rule which our Saviour hath given us, <hi>viz. Bleſs them that curſe you; Bleſs, I ſay, and curſe not: Mat.</hi> 5. 44.</p>
               <p>Again, If eternal bleſſedneſs in the world to come ſhall be the reward and portion of Gods Elect, then we ſhould learn from hence too, That Chriſtians muſt live in this world as becometh <hi>Gods</hi> Elect, that ſo they may receive the portion of ſuch in the world to come. Now it becometh <hi>Gods</hi> Elect, in this life, to know <hi>God,</hi> to fear him, to love him, to beleeve in him, to hope in him, to be zealous for him, and willing to keep his Commandments.

               <p n="4">4. Becauſe Chriſt was not made a curſe for them, as he was for the Elect, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.

               <p>But my meaning is, to ſpeak of theſe things more fully in the following Sections: And it may ſuffice to mention them in this place, becauſe all that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this, touching this curſed condition of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, was, to ſpeak of it in a general way; which I have done accordingly in this ſecond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>And this curſed condition of theirs may inform <label type="milestone">

               <p> Firſt, That it had been good for Reprobates if they had never been born, as our Saviour ſaid of <hi>Judas:</hi> for if they had never been born, they had never been ſubject to the curſe of <hi>God:</hi> But now ſeeing they have been, are, or ſhall be, all born, it will follow from hence, That they ſhall be curſed for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it will be worſe with Reprobates in the world to come, then in this. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In this they are ſeldom ſenſible of the curſe of <hi>God,</hi> but do often think themſelves to be the bleſſed of the Lord: but in that, they ſhall ſtill be ſenſible of the curſe of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In this, they meet with divers things that take off from them the meditation and thought of <hi>Gods</hi> curſe; as riches, pleaſures, profits, honors, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry companions, &amp;c. But in that world they ſhall not meet with any thing that ſhall take off from them the meditation and thought of <hi>Gods</hi> curſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this, there is ſtill hope that they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and ſo eſcape the eternal curſe of <hi>God:</hi> But in that world there ſhall be no hope of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, If we will not be curſed with Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in the world to come, we muſt take heed of final impenitency and unbelief, the moſt proper ſins of Reprobates; and ſee that we be ſoundly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: and then, not till then, we ſhall be ſafe from the eternal curſe of <hi>God.</hi>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, As touching <hi>the Nature of it;</hi> I affirm, <hi>That they ſhall be ſaved from all the Evils of the World to come, that ſhall be found therein:</hi> And this <hi>Salvation</hi> of theirs ſhall be all one with <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,</hi> with <hi>Redemption,</hi> with <hi>Preſervation,</hi> or <hi>ſafe-keeping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſhall be all one with <hi>Deliverance:</hi> for ſo far as any in this world are delivered from the evil of it, they are ſaved from the evil of it. Now Gods
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93010:89"/> Elect ſhall be delivered from all the evils of the world to come, according to the laſt Petition of the Lords Prayer, <hi>But deliver us from evil, Mat.</hi> 6. 13. And in this ſence they ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>It ſhall be all one with <hi>Redemption:</hi> for ſo far as any in this world are redeemed from the evil of it, they are ſaved from it: Now Gods Elect ſhall be fully and perfectly redeemed from the evils of the world to come; according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Your Redemption draweth nigh, Luk.</hi> 21. 28. In this ſence alſo they ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>It ſhall be all one with <hi>Preſervation</hi> or <hi>ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping:</hi> for ſo far as any are preſerved, and ſafely kept, in this world, from the evil of it, they are ſaved from it: Now Gods Elect ſhall be fully and perfectly preſerved, and ſafely kept, from the Evils of the world to come; according to that promiſe, <hi>The Lord ſhall preſerve thee from all evil: Yea, it is even he that ſhall keep thy Soul: Pſal.</hi> 121. 7. And in this ſence too they ſhall be ſaved. In ſhort, there is no evil that ſhall touch them, or happen unto them, in the world to come, either from God, from Chirſt, from the good Angels, from evil Angels, from themſelves, from Reprobates, or from other creatures. There is no evil that ſhall happen unto them, in reſpect of their Souls, bodies, names, or outward eſtates: for as they ſhall gain much, ſo they ſhall ſuffer no loſs; as they ſhall receive much good, ſo they ſhall receive no evil from the hands of God in the world to come: And ſo we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the nature of their Salvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As concerning <hi>the certainty of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> I affirm, <hi>That Gods Elect ſhall moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſaved in the World to come:</hi> As we may
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93010:89"/> well conceive for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they were from <hi>everlasting appointed and choſen unto Salvation:</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 9. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. And they that were from everlaſting appointed unto it, ſhall be ſaved in the world to come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe they are, or ſhall be, all regenerated: And they that are, or ſhall be, regenerated, ſhall be ſaved in the world to come: <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 28.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe they are, or ſhall be, all juſtified by the blood of Chriſt: And they that are, or ſhall be, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his blood, ſhall be ſaved from wrath by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe they are, or ſhall be, all reconciled to God by the death of his Son: And they that ſhall be reconciled to God by the death of his Son, ſhall be ſaved by his life: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe they are, or ſhall be, all the adopted children of God by grace: And all that are, or ſhall be, the adopted children of God by grace, ſhall be ſaved in the world to come, becauſe they are <hi>heirs of Salvation, Hebr.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Becauſe they do, or ſhall, beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt effectually: And they that do, or ſhall, beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt effectually, ſhall be ſaved in the world to come, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 31. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Becauſe they do, or ſhall, repent unfainedly: And they that do, or ſhall, repent unfainedly, ſhall be ſaved in the world to come; ſeeing this is called <hi>Repentance unto Salvation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Becauſe they do, or ſhall, all hope in <hi>God</hi> with a lively hope: And they that do, or ſhall, hope in <hi>God with a lively hope,</hi> ſhall be ſaved in the world to come: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:93010:90"/> 9. Becauſe they do, or ſhall, all fear the Lord with <hi>a godly fear:</hi> And they that do, or shall, fear the Lord with <hi>a godly fear,</hi> shall be ſaved, not onely in this world, but alſo in the world to come: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 9.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Becauſe they do, or shall, all <hi>walk ſincerely and uprightly before the Lord:</hi> And they that do, or ſhall, <hi>walk ſincerely and uprightly before the Lord,</hi> ſhall be ſaved in the world to come: <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 18.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Becauſe they do, or ſhall, all <hi>call upon the name of the Lord in ſincerity:</hi> And they that ſo do, or ſhall do, ſhall be ſaved in the world to come: <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 13.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Becauſe they have endured, or ſhall endure, conſtantly in the ſtate of grace to the end: And they that ſhall ſo endure to the end, ſhall be ſaved in the world to come: <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 22.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Becauſe they have an inward right to all the Promiſes of Salvation: as to theſe amongſt the reſt; <hi>Salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks, Iſai.</hi> 26. 1. <hi>But Iſrael ſhall be ſaved, Iſai.</hi> 45. 17. <hi>In mount Sion ſhall be Deliverance, Joel</hi> 2. 32. <hi>Obadi.</hi> 17. <hi>Iſrael ſhall be ſaved, as it is written, There ſhall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and ſhal turn away ungodlineſs from Jacob, Rom.</hi> 11. 26. In which promiſes, I underſtand, by <hi>mount Sion,</hi> the triumphant Church of <hi>Gods</hi> Elect in the World to come, not excluding the Militant: And by <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the whole body of <hi>Gods</hi> Elect, who are fully to enjoy theſe Promiſes in the world to come, and not before. And thus may we underſtand <hi>the certainty of their Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, As concerning <hi>the cauſes of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> I affirm;</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:93010:90"/> 1. That the efficient cauſe of their Salvation in the world to come, ſhall be the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: For <hi>Salvation belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>And the Salvation of the righteous is of him, Pſal.</hi> 37. 39. <hi>And the full Salvation of Iſrael ſhall come from him out of the heavenly Sion, Pſal.</hi> 14. 6. <hi>And Iſrael ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Lord, Iſai.</hi> 45. 17. that is, by the Lord <hi>Jehovah, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the principal moving cauſe of their Salvation in the world to come, is, and ſhall be, <hi>the Grace of God;</hi> I mean, the gracious good will and pleaſure of <hi>God</hi> from everlaſting: And for this cauſe it is ſaid, <hi>We are ſaved by Grace, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8. And <hi>it is the grace of God that bringeth Salvation, Tit.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the principal final cauſe of this their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſhall be <hi>the glory of Gods mercy:</hi> He ſhall ſave them, that he may glorifie his mercy upon them; which the Prophet knew well, and therefore prayed, <hi>That God would ſave him for his mercies ſake, Pſal.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>and according to his mercy, Pſal.</hi> 109. verſ. 26.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The meritorious cauſe of this their Salvation, is, and ſhall be, onely Chriſt: And <hi>there is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other, Act.</hi> 4. 12. as in the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe: But he is <hi>the Author of eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> equal with the <hi>Father,</hi> in an efficient way; as Mediator, and as <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi> in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in a meritorious way, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. 9. And <hi>he it is by whom this Salvation is to be obtained,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The inſtrumental cauſe of this their Salvation, is, and shall be, the Word of <hi>God</hi> read and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For this Word hath an inſtrumental power <hi>to</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:93010:91"/> 
                  <hi>ſave Souls, Jam.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>The Gospel is the power of God to Salvation, Rom.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>By it a man may be made wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>And it pleaſeth God, by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that beleeve,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The diſpoſitive or helping cauſes of this their Salvation, are, and ſhall be, all ſpiritual bleſſings, or ſaving graces, in this life; as <hi>Justification, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, Faith, Hope, Love, &amp;c. For theſe are the things that accompany Salvation, Hebr.</hi> 6. 9. And theſe are the things that do fit and prepare men for Salvation in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As concerning <hi>the extent of this their Salvation,</hi> I affirm; 1. That it ſhall extend to all the particular perſons of Gods Elect, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> by nature; for it is ſaid plainly, <hi>All Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſhall be ſaved, Rom.</hi> 11. 26. that is, all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved;</hi> that is, all his Elect, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>The promiſe ſhall be ſure to all the ſeed,</hi> that is, to all the Elect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>God preſerveth all them that love him, Pſa.</hi> 145. 20. He preſerveth them not onely from temporal dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but he will alſo preſerve them unto Salvation in the world to come. Yea, we find, <hi>That the whole houſe of Iſrael,</hi> that is, the whole Family of Gods Elect, <hi>ſhall be ſaved, Ezek.</hi> 37. 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 39. 25. And, 2. as this Salvation ſhall extend to all their perſons, ſo it ſhall extend to them in all reſpects, both in reſpect of their Souls and bodies; for their Souls ſhall be ſaved in the Day of the Lord, and <hi>they ſhall receive the end of their Faith, the Salvation of their Souls,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. And if their Souls, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are united to glorified bodies, ſhall be ſaved, doubtleſs their glorified bodies ſhall be ſaved too.</p>

                  </label> alſo againſt many plain places of Scripture, to impute this ſin of total and final Apoſtacy to any of Gods Elect Saints, (though ſome of Satans Saints may be guilty thereof,) as I have ſhewed often upon other occaſions: ſeeing <hi>God hath promiſed to preſerve and keep them from this ſin, Pſa.</hi> 119. 165. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32. 40. And our Saviour hath ſhewed, <hi>That the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect cannot poſſibly be ſeduced ſo far, as to be guilty of it, Mat.</hi> 24 24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It makes for the confutation of ſuch as think, <hi>That our good works in this life are merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and ſhall merit Salvation in the World to come.</hi> Which Popiſh conceit is in no wiſe to be granted neither.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe Chriſt our Mediator is <hi>the onely meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:93010:92"/> 
                  <hi>cauſe of Salvation,</hi> as was ſaid before out of <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12:</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>our beſt works are very imperfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mixt with much evil, Rom.</hi> 7. 21. By reaſon whereof our beſt performances are but half good performances, if they be ſo much: How then can they merit at Gods hands? Can a ſervant merit at our hands by half performances?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe <hi>our beſt works are but debts,</hi> ſeeing we are debtors to the whole Moral Law, to do the works therein preſcribed: How then can they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? Can we merit any thing by paying our debts, or by half payment of them? No: we muſt pay our debts to avoyd the danger of impriſonment: But we muſt do more then this, if we will merit at the hands of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe <hi>our beſt works are but duty, Luk.</hi> 17. 10. And can our ſervant merit any thing at our hands by doing his duty? No: neither can we at Gods hands; but we muſt do more then our duty, if we will merit from him: whereas we cannot do half our duty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe we are but <hi>meer men;</hi> and never did any meer man merit at the hands of <hi>God:</hi> The man Chriſt Jeſus did, becauſe he was <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi> in one perſon: But we are not like unto him, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his perſon; therefore we cannot merit as he did.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>God</hi> will reward the good actions of men performed in this life, according to the meaſure and degrees of good that he finds in them: But this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall be cauſed by Gods free grace, not by our works; it ſhall be occaſioned by Gods bounty, not by mans merit: And though God may make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93010:93"/> a debtor to us by his promiſe, yet we cannot make him a Debtor to us by our doings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It may inform us, <hi>That Gods Elect ſhould not despair of Salvation, ſeeing it is moſt certain that they ſhall all be ſaved in the World to come.</hi> Yea, ſuppoſe ſome of them are not yet ſure of their Election, yet they ſhould not deſpair of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe that particular Aſſurance, which is wanting for the preſent, may be had hereafter: and we know not what a day, a week, a moneth, or a year, may bring forth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe this particular Aſſurance is not ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to Salvation, as other gifts of God are, but a Chriſtian may be ſaved without it, as doubtleſs many have been.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe our Salvation doth not depend upon our Aſſurance, but upon our Election. If a man be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, there is nothing that ſhall deprive him of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>Indeed, I grant this Aſſurance to be a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable bleſsing, ſuch as we ſhould deſire, ſeek, and pray for: yea, we ſhould <hi>be diligent to make our Election ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. Yet in caſe a Chriſtian want this Aſſurance, and, after long ſeeking, cannot obtain it, he ſhould not be ſo far diſcouraged, as to deſpair of his Salvation; but in this caſe he ſhould ſtill beleeve in the Lord Chriſt, and depend upon him for Salvation; which if he do, he ſhall be ſaved, though he want this Aſſurance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What think you then of Reprobates, may not ſuch</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>despair of Salvation?</hi> I anſwer;</p>
               <p>If a man in this life could certainly know himſelf <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> to be a Reprobate, and to be none of Gods Elect,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93010:93"/> he might have ſome excuſe for this ſin: But it is not poſsible for any in this life to know himſelf to be ſuch an one for certain, becauſe our final and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate condition doth not yet appear unto us: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man living in this world may deſpair of his future Salvation, be he never ſo wicked and vile a ſinner for the preſent; but he ſhould ſtill think in charity towards himſelf, that he may be one of <hi>Gods</hi> Elect, though he be not certain of it; and that he may poſſibly be ſaved by his future Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as well as others, though it be ill with him for the preſent. For we muſt know, that God doth never, by his Word, or Spirit, perſwade any to deſpair of their Salvation: but ſuggeſtions of this nature do uſually, and for the moſt part, come from Satan, the father of lyes. God perſwades all afflicted ſinners <hi>to beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for ſalvation.</hi> But Satan perſwades an afflicted ſinner <hi>to deſpair of ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> with ſuch ſuggeſtions as theſe; <hi>Thou art a Reprobate: Thou art none of Gods Elect; none of thoſe for whom Chriſt dyed; thou haſt no part in Chriſt: therefore it is in vain for thee to hope for Salvation in the World to come.</hi> In all which ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, Satan acts the part of a lyar, becauſe he doth not certainly know any of theſe things to be true of this or that particular perſon, whiles he is yet alive in the body. Wherefore an afflicted ſinner ſhould not liſten to theſe ſuggeſtions of Satan, but he ſhould attend to the counſel of Gods Word, and labor to beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as we are all bound to do, eſpecially in difficult caſes, that we may be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It may inform us, <hi>That Gods Elect ſhould be conſtantly willing to dye, and to leave this</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:93010:94"/> 
                  <hi>world;</hi> becauſe it is moſt certain, <hi>that they ſhall all be ſaved in the World to come, with a full, perfect, and everlaſting Salvation;</hi> as hath been prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: whereas they cannot expect any ſuch Salvation in this world. And, amongſt other conſiderations, theſe three eſpecially ſhould make them willing to dye, and leave this world: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Death will put an end to the practice of ſin:</hi> As long as we live here, we ſhall ſtill be in a poſture of ſinning; but after death we ſhall ſin no more: And ſhould we not be willing that theſe days of ſin may be finiſhed? Yes: Then we ſhould be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dye.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Death will put an end to all the afflictions of this life, which are cauſed by ſin;</hi> as <hi>wants, neceſſities, loſſes, croſſes, ſickneſſes, diſeaſes, vexations, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, of what kinde ſoever:</hi> And ſhould we not be willing to be delivered from all ſuch afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Yes: Then we ſhould be willing to dye.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Death is that which will put Gods Elect into the poſſeſſion of good things promiſed:</hi> as <hi>glory, honor, immortality, peace, joy, tranquillity, &amp;c.</hi> And ſhould we not be willing to be put in the poſſeſſion of ſuch things? Yes: Then we ſhould be willing to dye.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let not any of Gods Elect ſay, <hi>We could be well contented to abide in this world ſtill; it is good for us to be here, and to build Tabernacles here:</hi> For if it be good for them to be here, it will be much better for them to be elſewhere, either in Heaven, or in the World to come: and the greater good is more to be deſired, then the leſſer. And if our hearts hanker never ſo much after this world, we muſt leave it of neceſſity, ſooner, or later: But
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93010:94"/> it will be more acceptable, and praiſe-worthy, if we ſhall leave it willingly, whenſoever <hi>the Meſſengers of death</hi> ſhall be ſent unto us.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It ſhould inform us, <hi>That ſuch as deſire to be ſaved with Gods Elect, in the World to come, ſhould neither neglect, nor contemn, the ordinary means of Salvation, which God hath prepared and aſſigned for them;</hi> whether they be inward, as, <hi>Faith, Repentance, Hope, Love, Fear, &amp;c.</hi> or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as, <hi>the adminiſtration of the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, reading, ſinging, prayer, thanksgiving, in publique, or private, &amp;c.</hi> For <hi>how ſhall we eſcape the judgments of God, if we neglect, or contemn, ſo great Salvation, as God tenders unto us by theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means? Hebr.</hi> 2. 3. And ſurely it will be in vam for any to ſay, <hi>If I be elected, I ſhall be ſaved, though I neglect, or contemn, the ordinary means;</hi> becauſe all ſuch as are elected to be ſaved in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way, are alſo elected to the conſcionable uſe of ſuch ordinary means, as are, or ſhall be, aſsigned for them in way to Salvation.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it ſhould be remembred, that we are commanded <hi>to work out our own Salvation with fear and trembling, Phil.</hi> 2. 12. Now <hi>to work out our own Salvation,</hi> is all one as to endevor our own Salvation in and by the uſe of ordinary means, that ſo we may <hi>ſave our ſelves,</hi> as the phraſe is, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 40. And <hi>to work out our own Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> is to endevor it in a reverential way, ſo as to ſtand in awe of Gods diſpleaſure, and of Gods temporal Judgments: For, as long as we live here, we are ſtill in danger of diſpleaſing him by our ſins, and of ſuffering for our ſins: For which cauſe we ſhould fear both the Offence of God, and the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93010:95"/> Judgments of God; and ſo <hi>work out our own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling.</hi> And ſurely it is not ſo eaſie a matter, as ſome think it to be: for he that will be ſaved in an ordinary way, muſt be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do much, and to ſuffer much, in obedience to Gods Will, before he ſhall come to inherit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: For which cauſe Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the righteous ſhall ſcarcely be ſaved,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 18. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>A man ſhall be ſaved; yet ſo, as by fire,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15. Wherefore we ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>to work out our own Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Propoſition is, <hi>That Reprobates ſhall</hi>

               <p>Firſt, As touching <hi>the Nature of it;</hi> I affirm, <hi>That they ſhall be deſtroyed in the World to come;</hi> not in a natural ſence, ſo as to be brought to nothing; for <hi>Reprobates</hi> ſhall have a Being in the world to come to their great grief: but they ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſpiritual or myſtical ſence, ſo as to be brought into a very evil condition, and ſo as to be put to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure all ſorts of evils, which ſhall be incidental to the world to come, whether they ſhall be evils of loſs, or evils of ſence; Soul evils, or bodily evils; internal, or external evils: Yea, it ſhall be evil for them to have any Being; it ſhall be evil for them to ſee what they shall ſee, to hear what they shall hear,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93010:95"/> to ſpeak what they ſhall ſpeak, and do what they ſhall do, in the World to come. So their laſt day ſhall be an <hi>evil day,</hi> or <hi>a day of evil, Prov.</hi> 16. 4. and <hi>their laſt end ſhall be worſe then their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> And as in this world, ſo in the world to come, <hi>evil ſhall bunt and purſue them, to overthrow them, Pſal.</hi> 140. 11. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 21. Which evil condition of theirs ſhall be their deſtruction, their full and final deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As concerning <hi>the certainty of it,</hi> I ſay, <hi>That Reprobates ſhall moſt certainly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in the world to come:</hi> As may be proved by theſe Arguments:</p>
               <p n="1">1. They whoſe <hi>laſt end ſhall be deſtruction,</hi> shall be deſtroyed in the world to come: But the <hi>laſt end</hi> of <hi>Reprobates</hi> shall be <hi>deſtruction, Phil.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They that are <hi>veſſels fitted for deſtruction,</hi> shall be deſtroyed in the world to come: But <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates</hi> are <hi>veſſels fited for deſtruction, Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. They that are <hi>made to be deſtroyed,</hi> shall be deſtroyed in the world to come: <hi>Reprobates</hi> are <hi>made to be deſtroyed, Prov.</hi> 16. 4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. I do not ſay, they are made to be deſtroyed for nought, but for ſin. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They that will <hi>never beleeve effectually,</hi> shall be deſtroyed in the world to come; as was prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fore-shewed by the deſtruction of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> at the red Sea; <hi>God having ſaved the Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites from them, afterward deſtroyed them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved not, Jude</hi> 5.

               <p n="6">6.

               <p>Fourthly, As concerning <hi>the extent of their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> I affirm, <hi>That it ſhall extend to all of them in general, and particular:</hi> For becauſe <hi>they will not repent, they ſhall all periſh, Luk.</hi> 13. 1, 2. <hi>and ſhall all be deſtroyed, Pſa.</hi> 145. 20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 62. 3. and that in all reſpects.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, As touching <hi>the continuance of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> I ſay, <hi>That it ſhall continue for ever:</hi> For it is written concerning wicked Reprobates, <hi>That they ſhall be deſtroyed for ever, Pſa.</hi> 52. 5.

               <p>I Am now to ſpeak of a ſecond ſpecial difference, which ſhall be betwixt Gods Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in the World to come: and this difference may be thus expreſſed in two Propoſitions: <hi>viz.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Touching <hi>the nature of it;</hi> I ſay that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life is not here to be taken in a natural ſence, but in a ſpiritual and myſtical ſence: for if we ſhould take it in a <hi>natural ſence,</hi> it can be nothing elſe, but an everlaſting conjunction of the Soul of man with his body; which Life ſhall be common to good and bad, to Elect and Reprobates, in the World to come; becauſe, after the general Reſurrection, they ſhall both live for ever, both in their Souls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, united and conjoyned, and ſo ſhall both have everlaſting life in a natural ſence: But here <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life</hi> is to be taken in a ſpiritual and myſtical
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93010:98"/> ſence; and ſo it ſhall be nothing elſe but an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Conjunction with God and with Chriſt: And ſo when I ſay, <hi>That Gods Elect ſhall enjoy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Life in the World to come,</hi> my meaning is, That they ſhall enjoy an everlaſting Conjunction with God and with Chriſt, or an everlaſting Union and Communion with God and with Chriſt, in the World to come: By reaſon whereof it is ſaid, That they <hi>ſhall ever be with the Lord Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 17. They ſhall be with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13. They ſhall be with him where he is, and ſhall ſee his glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. and ſhall be perfect in one with the Father and the Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 22. 23. And by vertue of this everlaſting Conjunction with God and with Chriſt, they ſhall ſtill have experience of Gods goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in Chriſt, and ſhall know that <hi>his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs endureth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 52. 1. By vertue of it they ſhall ſtill have experience of Gods mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in Chriſt, and ſhall know that <hi>his mercy endureth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 136. and that <hi>his mercy is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 103. 17. By vertue of it they ſhall ſtill have experience of Gods Love towards them in Chriſt, &amp; ſhall perceive, <hi>that neither things preſent, nor things to come, ſhall ſeparate them from it,</hi> Rom. 8. 38, 39. And by vertue of it they ſhall ſtill have experience of Gods favour and fellowſhip with them in Chriſt, and ſhall know that <hi>Gods Tabernacle ſhall be with them, and that he ſhall dwell with them, and be their God for ever,</hi> Rev. 21. 3. Which everlaſting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of theirs, with God and with Chriſt, ſhall be unto them everlaſting Life, and that everlaſting Life which is promiſed in the Scriptures. And ſo we may underſtand <hi>the Nature of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:93010:98"/>
               <p> Secondly, Touching <hi>the Certainty of it,</hi> I ſay, <hi>That Gods Elect ſhall moſt certainly enjoy everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life in the World to come:</hi> As may be made good by theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They whoſe names are in the <hi>Book of Life,</hi> ſhall have everlaſting Life in the World to come: But Gods Elect have and ſhall have all their names found in the <hi>Book of Life, Phil.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They that are ordained unto eternal Life, ſhall enjoy everlaſting Life in the World to come: But Gods Elect are all ordained unto eternal Life, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They that ſhall have the gift of eternal Life, ſhall enjoy everlaſting Life in the World to come: But Gods Elect ſhall have the gift of eternal Life; as it is written, <hi>The Father hath given Chriſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal Life to as many as the Father hath given him,</hi> Joh. 17. 2. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They that are Heirs of eternal Life, ſhall enjoy everlaſting Life in the World to come: But Gods Elect are or ſhall be all Heirs of eternal Life, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. They that are or ſhall be juſtified and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed righteous before God through Chriſt, ſhall enjoy everlaſting Life in the World to come; according to that of our Saviour, <hi>The righteous ſhall go into everlaſting Life,</hi> Mat. 25. 46. But Gods Elect are or ſhall be all juſtified and accounted righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God through Chriſt. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. They that are or ſhall be ſanctified, or made Partakers of renewed Holineſs, ſhall enjoy everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life in the World to come, as it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93010:99"/> But Gods Elect are or ſhall be all ſanctified, and made Partakers of renewed Holineſs. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. They that do or ſhall beleeve effectually in Gop and in Chriſt, ſhall enjoy everlaſting Life in the World to come; as may appear, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. and 6. 40, 47. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 16. But Gods Elect do or ſhall all beleeve effectually in God and in Chriſt. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. They that do or ſhall repent unfeignedly, ſhall enjoy everlaſting Life in the World to come; becauſe unfeigned Repentance is called <hi>Repentance unto life,</hi> Acts 11. 18. But Gods Elect do or ſhall all repent unfeignedly. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. They that are or ſhall be conſtant in well-doing, ſhall enjoy everlaſting Life in the World to come, as appears, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. But Gods Elect are or ſhall be conſtant in well-doing. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>

They that are or ſhall be conſtant in graces received, ſhall enjoy everlaſting Life in the World to come, as it is promiſed; <hi>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of Life,</hi> Rev. 2. 10. But Gods Elect are or ſhall be thus conſtant, or thus faithful. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. They that do or ſhall, in obedience to Gods Will, ſuffer more or leſs for Chriſts ſake, or the Goſpels ſake, ſhall enjoy everlaſting Life in the World to come, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>There is no man that hath left houſe, or brethren, or ſisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Touching <hi>the Cauſes of this everlaſting Life,</hi> I ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Efficient Cauſe of it ſhall be the whole Trinity, God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: And to aſſure us hereof, eternal Life is called <hi>the gift of God,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. And S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, That <hi>God hath given unto us eternal Life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 11. where the Name of God devotes not any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon in the Godhead, but the whole Trinity; and ſo the whole Trinity is the Efficient Cauſe of everlaſting Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Impulſive or Moving Cauſe of it ſhall be the grace of God, or his gracious Will: <hi>For as ſin hath raigned unto death, ſo ſhall grave raign through righteouſneſs unto eternal Life,</hi> Rom. 5. 21.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Meritorious Cauſe of it is and ſhall be only Chriſt: For <hi>in him was life,</hi> Joh. 1. 4. <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life, he that hath not the Son, hath not life,</hi> 1 Ioh. 5. 12. They that <hi>ſhall raign in life, ſhall raign by one, Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 5 17 21. And <hi>the Father hath given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as the Father hath given him,</hi> Ioh. 17. 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Final Cauſe of it ſhall be the glory of Gods mercy, that he may glorifie his mercy upon his Elect: <hi>He will give unto them eternal Life in the World to come.</hi>

               <p>Which Propoſition thus cleared, may be uſeful <label type="milestone">

               <p> Firſt, By what hath been ſaid, we may diſcern ſome difference betwixt <hi>eternal Salvation</hi> and <hi>eternal Life;</hi> becauſe <hi>eternal Salvation,</hi> in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſence, ſhall be an eternal Preſervation from the evils of the World to come; but <hi>eternal Life,</hi> in a proper ſence, ſhall be an eternal Conjunction, Union or Communion with God and with Chriſt. Indeed this difference hath not been obſerved by all Writers, but many have ſpoken confuſedly of the World to come, and of the things which ſhall be contained in it: And though the ſame men, when they ſpeak of temporal ſalvation, temporal life, glory, liberty, peace, &amp;c. can diſtinguiſh them; yet when they ſpeak of eternal Salvation, eternal Life, Glory, Liberty, Peace, &amp;c. they will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh; as if eternal things needed not to be diſtinguiſhed, as well as temporal.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may inform us, <hi>That Gods Elect ſhall be no loſers in the World to come, by any thing they ſhall do or ſuffer in obedience to Gods Will in this world:</hi> For ſuppoſe they ſhall do much here, in obedience to his Will, as pray much, hear much, read much, meditate much, beleeve much, repent much, love much, &amp;c. and ſuppoſe they ſhall ſuffer much here, in obedience to Gods Will, as the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and contempt of the world, the reproaches, lyes and ſlanders of wicked men, the ſpoyling of their goods, impriſonment ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, It may inform us, <hi>That Gods Elect can loſe nothing by a temporal death, in reſpect of the conſequent thereof:</hi> Becauſe <hi>the day of death</hi> ſhall be <hi>better</hi> unto them <hi>then the day of their birth, Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 1. And this temporal death ſhall be ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with everlaſting Life in the World to come. Wherefore when God calls us to ſuffer a temporal death, whether natural or violent, eſpecially for Chriſts ſake and the Goſpels, we ſhould even hate our own lives, ſeeing our Saviour hath ſaid, <hi>He that loveth his life, ſhall loſe it; and he that hateth his life in this world, ſhall keep it unto life eternal,</hi> Joh. 12. 25. <hi>And whoſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it; but whoſoever will loſe his life for my ſake, ſhall find it,</hi> Mat. 16. 25.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It may inform us, <hi>That Gods Elect ſhould not doubt of everlasting Life in the World to come;</hi> becauſe the Word makes it ſure unto them by many promiſes: And yet if any of them are not ſatisfied in their conſciences concerning this matter, they muſt be <hi>diligent to make their Calling and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10. and to be ſure of a lively faith: And being aſſured of theſe things, muſt know that they ſhall have life eternal, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 13.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It may inform us, <hi>That Gods Elect ſhould conſtantly hope for eternal life, and live in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof:</hi> becauſe this hope is commended, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 7. and it is that whereby we may <hi>lay hold of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 12. and that without which the beſt Chriſtians are <hi>in this life of all men moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. being moſt of all expoſed to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93010:101"/> the hatred, and contempt, and violence of this world.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It may inform us, <hi>That ſuch as deſire to enjoy everlaſting life with Gods Elect, muſt chuſe the way that leadeth thereunto, and walk in it:</hi> For there is but one way that leadeth unto eternal life, and unleſs we find it, chuſe it, and walk in it, we ſhall never obtain our deſire in this reſpect. Now the way that leadeth unto eternal life is ſo deſcribed in the Scriptures, that we may know it from other ways; for it is called <hi>the ſtrait way, the narrow way, the old way,</hi> and <hi>the good way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is called the <hi>ſtrait way, Mat.</hi> 7. 14. becauſe it is the way of Gods Commandments; which way allows of no turning to the right hand, or to the left, but leads ſtraight on; and as long as we are in it, we go ſtraight on; but if we deviate or ſwerve from it, we turn either to the right hand, or to the left.</p>
               <p>It is called the <hi>narrow way, Mat.</hi> 7. 14. becauſe it is frequented but by few paſſangers and travellers: and a way may be ſaid to be broad or narrow accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the number of travellers in it; a multitude of travellers make a broad way, a paucity of travellers makes a narrow way.</p>
               <p>It is called the <hi>old way;</hi> becauſe the faithful of old time walked in it, as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Joſeph, Moſes, Joſhua, Samuel, David, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is called a <hi>good way;</hi> becauſe ſuch good things as are evidences and pledges of eternal life may be found in it: As in it we may find,</p>

               <p>Firſt, Touching <hi>the Nature of it:</hi> I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Reprobates ſhall ſuffer everlaſting Death in a natural ſence; for then their ſouls ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly ſeparated from their bodies in the World to come, which may not be granted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But they ſhall ſuffer everlaſting Death in a ſpiritual or myſtical
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93010:102"/> ſence; that is to ſay, they ſhall ſuffer an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparation of their whole man from God, from Chriſt, and the Saints, from all Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them: Which ſeparation of theirs from God and from Chriſt, may be gathered from that one ſaying which Chriſt ſhall pronounce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them at the Day of Judgment; <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniquity,</hi> Luk. 13. 27. And their ſeparation from the Saints is illuſtrated in the Goſpel by the ſeparation of goats from ſheep <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 32. as alſo by the ſevering of the bad fiſh from the good, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 49. Now by reaſon of this everlaſting ſeparation of theirs from all Union and Communion with God, with Chriſt, and the Saints, they ſhall never have any experience of Gods Goodneſs, Mercy, and Love towards them in Chriſt: Neither ſhall they ever have any expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Saints favour and fellowſhip, but ſhall ſtill abide under the wrath of God: And ſo this everlaſting ſeparation of theirs will be unto them an everlaſting Death; and this Death is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture <hi>the ſecond Death,</hi> Rev. 20. 6, 14. becauſe it ſhall follow immediately upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the firſt death: For the natural death of mankind, (which is the firſt death) ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed at the general Reſurrection, and thereupon ſhall begin this, <hi>the ſecond Death.</hi> It is called <hi>everlaſting puniſhment, Mat.</hi> 25. 46. becauſe it ſhall be ſuch a puniſhment to thoſe that ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it.

               <p> Secondly, Touching <hi>the Certainty of it,</hi> I affirm, <hi>That Reprobates ſhall moſt certainly ſuffer this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Death in the World to come:</hi> As may be made good by theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They who ſhall not have their names found in the Book of Life, ſhall ſuffer everlaſting Death in the World to come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 15. But Reprobates ſhall not have their names found in the Book of Life. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They that will never beleeve effectually, ſhall dye in the guilt of their ſins, and ſo ſuffer everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death in the World to come, <hi>John</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. But Reprobates will never beleeve effectually. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. They that will never unfeignedly repent, and ſo turn from their evil ways, ſhall ſuffer everlaſting Death in the World to come; as may appear, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. 20. But Reprobates will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unfeignedly repent, and ſo turn from their evil ways. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. They that will Apoſtatize, and grow worſe and worſe, ſhall ſuffer everlaſting Death in the World to come; as may appear, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. 24. But Reprobates will ſtill Apoſtatize, and grow worſe and worſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. They that will ſtill hate wholeſom reproof, ſhall ſuffer eternal Death in the World to come,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:93010:103"/> according to that of <hi>Solomon, He that hateth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof ſhall dye, Prov.</hi> 15. 10. But Rebrobates will ſtill hate reproof while they ſhall remain here. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. They that will ſtill and finally be wicked perſons, ſhall ſuffer eternal Death in the World to come, according to that of the Lord, <hi>O wicked man, thou ſhalt ſurely dye, Ezek.</hi> 33. 8.

               </p>
               <p n="9">9. They that will ſtill deſpiſe Gods Ways and Commandments, ſhall be ſure to ſuffer everlaſting Death in the World to come, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that despiſeth his Ways ſhall dye, Prov.</hi> 19. 16. But Reprobates will ſtill thus do while they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in this world. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Touching <hi>the Cauſes of it,</hi> I affirm,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Efficient Cauſe of this their Death, ſhall be the whole Trinity, God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: For it is ſaid concerning wicked Reprobates, That <hi>God hath prepared for them the inſtruments of death, Pſal.</hi> 7. 13. <hi>And that he will kill their children with death, Rev.</hi> 2 23. And if the whole Trinity will do this, then it is the whole Trinity that ſhall inflict eternal Death upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates in the World to come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Meritorious Cauſe hereof is and ſhall be ſin for ſin only; and every ſin, in its own nature, deſerves death, both temporal and eternal; as it is written, <hi>Death entred by ſin, Rom.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>The wages of ſin is death, Rom.</hi> 6. 23. <hi>The Soul that ſinneth ſhall dye, Ezek.</hi> 18. 20. And though it be true, that all ſuch as have, or ſhall have, their ſins pardoned through Chriſt, ſhall eſcape eternal
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93010:103"/> Death, notwithſtanding the deſert of their ſin; yet it is moſt certain, that Reprobates ſhall ſuffer this Death in the World to come even for their ſin, as the Meritorious Cauſe thereof; and then they ſhall acknowledg that every ſin of theirs hath brought this Death upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Final Cauſe of it ſhall be the Glory of Gods Juſtice; for he ſhall puniſh them with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Death, that he may manifeſt the Glory of his Juſtice upon them, and that all men may ſee his Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>This latter Propoſition may inform us as before:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it had been good for Reprobates if they <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> had never been born: for if they had never been born, they could never have ſuffered everlaſting Death: But now ſeeing they have been, are, or ſhall be al born, this death ſhall ſeize upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it will be worſe with ſuch in the World to come then it can be with them in this world: for here they can ſuffer no other then a temporal death; but hereafter they ſhall ſuffer eternal death, not without cauſe, but for their ſins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That all men, living in the body, ſhould take ſome ſpeedy courſe for their own ſafety, that they be preſerved from eternal death; for I know that none of us are willing to ſuffer this death with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates in the World to come; and the Word of God preſcribes a way for the avoyding of it: And therefore all ſhould take this way, or this courſe, for their own ſafety and preſervation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But what courſe muſt we take for to preſerve our ſelves from this eternal death?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Firſt, We muſt earneſtly pray to have our ſins pardoned, as our Saviour hath taught us in his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93010:104"/> Prayer; and this pardon of ſin will preſerve us from eternal death; as may appear by that ſpeech of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> to <hi>David, God hath put away thy ſin; thou ſhalt not dye,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. as if he had ſaid, Though thou mayſt and muſt dye a temporal death, yet thou ſhalt not dye an eternal death, becauſe God hath pardoned thy ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe this pardon of ſin cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without a lively faith in Chriſt, we muſt, in the next place, labour and pray for this faith; and ſuch a faith as this will preſerve us from eternal death; as may appear by that ſaying of Chriſt to <hi>Martha, Whoſoever liveth, and beleeveth in me, he ſhall not dye, Joh.</hi> 11. 26. that is, though he dye a temporal death, yet he ſhall not an eternal death, becauſe he <hi>beleeveth in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe our faith cannot be good without repentance, we muſt alſo labour for a true and lively repentance; and ſuch a kind of repentance will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us from everlaſting Death; according to that of the Prophet: <hi>If the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye, Ezek.</hi> 18. 21. that is, he ſhall not dye eternally.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe our repentance cannot be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual without ſincere obedience, which includes an hearty deſire to keep the Commandments of God and of Chriſt, we muſt, in the laſt place, be willing and obedient to his Commandments; and this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience will preſerve us from eternal death; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of our Saviour: <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, If a man keep my ſayings, he ſhall not ſee death, Joh.</hi> 8. 51. that is, he ſhall never ſee eternal death, ſo as to ſuffer it.</p>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As concerning <hi>the Nature of it:</hi> By the <hi>Glory of Gods Elect in the World to come,</hi> I underſtand, that they shall have nothing to be ashamed of, but shall have much to glory of in that world.</p>
               <p>They shall have nothing to be ashamed of in that world, becauſe their ſins shall be all forgiven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. and they that shall have all their ſins forgiven in that world, and declared to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, shall have nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:93010:105"/>
               <p> And as they ſhall have all their ſins forgiven, ſo they ſhall have all their ſins forgotten in that world; for where God forgives any ſin, there will he alſo forget it, ſo as never to impute it, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43. 25. And they that ſhall have all their ſins forgotten, ſhall have nothing to be aſhamed of in that world.</p>
               <p>Again, As they ſhall have their ſins all forgotten, ſo ſhall they have their conſciences cleared from the guilt of ſin in the World to come, for they ſhall have boldneſs at the Day of Judgment, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 17. which boldneſs ſhall ariſe from a conſcience cleared and clenſed from the guilt of ſin, and ſhall continue for ever: and they that ſhall have their conſciences thus cleared, ſhall have nothing to be aſhamed of in that world.</p>
               <p>Yea, they ſhall have none to lay any thing to their charge in the World to come, as I gather from that Interrogation of the Apoſtle: <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Choſen? Rom.</hi> 8. 33. Seeing God, in and by Chriſt, hath or ſhall fully ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie all his Elect, he might well ſay, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to their charge?</hi> for doubleſs, neither God, nor Chriſt, nor Angels, nor Men, nor Devils, ſhall lay any thing to their charge in the World to come; and conſequently they ſhall have nothing to be aſhamed of in that world.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, they ſhall have much to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of, becauſe all their graces and vertues, with their ſeveral operations in this world, ſhall be remembred in the World to come; as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>A Book of Remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and thought upon his name, Mal.</hi> 3. 16. And they that ſhall have all their graces and vertues, with their ſeveral operations, in the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93010:105"/> World to come remembred, ſhall have much to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that world.</p>
               <p>Beſide this, they ſhall have all their graces and vertues illuſtrated, and made to ſhine before Angels and men in the World to come: For <hi>God ſhall bring forth their righteouſneſs as the light, and their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the noon day, Pſal.</hi> 37. 6. <hi>They that are wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the firmament, and they that turn many unto righteouſneſs, as the stars for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Dan.</hi> 12. 3. And <hi>the righteous ſhall ſhine as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father, Mat.</hi> 13. 43. And they that ſhall have their graces and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues thus illuſtrated, ſhall have much to glory of in that world.</p>
               <p>And which is more, they ſhall have all their graces and vertues perfected in the World to come: <hi>When that which is perfect is come, that which is imperfect ſhall be done away,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 10. Though it be hard to ſhew what uſe there ſhall be of ſome graces in the World to come, as of Repentance, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, &amp;c. yet becauſe all graces are imperfect in this life, doubtleſs they ſhall be all perfected hereafter in Gods Elect: And they that ſhall have all their graces and vertues perfected, ſhall have much to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of in that world.</p>
               <p>Yea, they ſhall have all their graces and vertues, with their ſeveral acts and operations, recompenced in the world to come; as <hi>Moſes</hi> expected, when <hi>he choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the People of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, Hebr.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93010:107"/> illuſtrateth by a compariſon taken from the natural glory of the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars: <hi>There is one glory of the Sun, and another glory of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars; for one Star differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from another in glory: So ſhall it be in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 41, 42. And if it ſhall be ſo in the Reſurrection, then it ſhall be ſo in the World to come, amongſt Gods Elect: And it was ſhewed before, <hi>That ſome of them ſhall ſhine as the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome as the Stars, and ſome as the Sun, in the Kingdom of their Father.</hi> Now for natural glory, we know the Sun hath more then the Moon, the Moon more then the Stars, ſome Stars more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And on the contrary, the Firmament hath leſs natural glory then the Stars, the Stars leſs then the Sun: So by theſe places and ſimilitudes we are taught what to think and judg of degrees of glory in the world to come.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As concerning <hi>the cauſes of it,</hi> I affirm:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the efficient cauſe of it ſhall be the whole <hi>Trinity,</hi> Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: For <hi>the God of glory</hi> ſhall glorifie his Elect in the world to come; and the whole <hi>Trinity</hi> is <hi>the God of glory, Pſa.</hi> 29. 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>And he ſhall give glory to the upright, Pſal.</hi> 84. 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the meritorious cauſe of it ſhall be onely Chriſt our Mediator, who is called <hi>the hope of glory, Col.</hi> 1. 27. and <hi>the Lord of glory, Jam.</hi> 2. 1. becauſe, in a meritorious way, he hath brought, and is to bring, <hi>many ſons unto glory, Hebr.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the final cauſe of it is and ſhal be <hi>the glory of Gods mercy:</hi> He wil glorifie his Elect in the world to come, that he may glorifie his mercy upon them; as he doth all things chiefly for his own glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36.</p>

                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:93010:107"/> 4.

               <p n="5">5.

                  </label> in the world to come, is uſually applied in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by way of Exhortation; to which purpoſe only I ſhall here alſo apply it: And in this Exhortation I ſhall ſpeak unto you all, as unto Gods Elect: For though I am not certain that all of you are of this ſort, and of this number, yet you may be all, or many of you, of this ſort, for ought I know to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Neither dare I ſay of any particular perſon, now living amongſt us, that this man, or this woman, is none of Gods Elect. Wherefore, ſuppoſing in my charity that you may be of this ſort, I now in this, as in all other Exhortations, ſpeak unto you, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch. And ſo exhort you:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be patient in all your preſent tribulations and afflictions, becauſe it is moſt certain that Gods Elect ſhall be rewarded with glory in the world to come; and therefore you ſhould be patient in the mean time: Eſpecially conſidering,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the afflictions of this, though grievous in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:93010:108"/> themſelves it may be, are but light, in compariſon of <hi>the glory that ſhall be revedled hereafter;</hi> and ſo not worthy to be compared with it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the afflictions of this life are but ſhort and momentary, in compariſon of the glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the afflictions of this life, if patiently ſuffered, in obedience to Gods will, ſhall be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced with glory, and ſo ſhall <hi>work for us a more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To be plentiful in good works; and in doing Gods Will: For <hi>to him that doth good, ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Rom.</hi> 2. 10. And <hi>look what good any man doth;</hi> in obedience to Gods Will, <hi>the ſame ſhall he receive, whether he be bond or free, Eph.</hi> 6. 8. Yea, the more good we ſhall do, in obedience to Gods Will, the more glory ſhall we receive; according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>He that ſoweth ſparingly, ſhall reap ſparingly; but he that ſoweth plentifully, ſhall reap plentifully,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To hope for glory in the world to come: For it is moſt certain that Gods Elect ſhall be rewarded with glory in that world, and therefore they ſhould conſtantly hope for it; as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers with him, did not onely <hi>hope for this glory,</hi> but alſo <hi>rejoyce in hope thereof, Rom.</hi> 5. 2. And this hope is that which will ſupport the Soul in the hour of temptation and diſtreſs; whereas without it the Soul is in danger of ſinking into the gulf of deſpair. Wherefore let <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtill hope in the Lord, and that for this glory which is to be revealed in the world to come.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To glorifie God in this world, and to give as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93010:108"/> much glory to him as we can: How elſe can we expect to be glorified of him in the world to come? And we ſhould here conſider; Firſt, That we are often commanded to glorifie God: <hi>Glorifie him ye ſons of Jacob, Pſal.</hi> 22. 23. <hi>Ye are bought with a price, therefore glorifie him both in your Souls and bodies, which are his,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. Secondly, That glory doth moſt rightly belong unto God, becauſe <hi>his glory is above Heaven and Earth, Pſal.</hi> 148. 13. Thirdly, That Gods glory is moſt dear unto him, becauſe <hi>he will not give his glory to another, Iſai.</hi> 42. 8. Fourthly, That God doth ſeek his own glory in all his actions for to teach us to do the like. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That <hi>Herod</hi> was puniſhed with ſudden death, becauſe <hi>he gave not glory to God,</hi> but to himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 23. Wherefore we ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to give all poſsible glory to God in this life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How may we glorifie him in this life?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Touching <hi>the nature of it,</hi> I conceive, That their ſhame in the World to come, ſhall be a total privation of glory; becauſe they ſhall have nothing to glory of in the World to come: no Innocency, no Righteouſneſs, no Holineſs, no Faith, no Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, no Love, no Obedience, &amp;c. but they ſhall have much to be aſhamed of.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:93010:109"/> 1. Becauſe their ſins in this world ſhall all be remembred, and ſet before them, as the Lord ſaith by the Prophet, <hi>Thou thoughtest, that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelfe; but I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order before thine eyes, Pſal.</hi> 50. 21. and they that ſhall have all their ſins remembred, and ſet before them in the World to come, ſhall have much to be aſhamed of in that world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe they ſhall have their conſciences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, to accuſe and condemne them in the World to come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. and if ſo, then they ſhall have much to be aſhamed of in that world.</p>

               <p>Secondly, touching the certainty of it; I ſay, that reprobates ſhall moſt certainly be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ſhame in the World to come, as may be good by theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They that will ſtill be wicked in this world ſhall be rewarded with ſhame in the world to come, according to the Prayer of <hi>David, Let not me be aſhamed, but let the wicked be aſhamed, Pſal.</hi> 31. 17. but reprobates will ſtill be wicked in this world: <hi>Ergo.</hi>

They that will ſtill be proud in this world, and live under the dominion of this ſin, ſhall be rewarded with ſhame in the world to come, according to the Prayer of <hi>David, Let the proud be aſhamed, Pſal.</hi> 119. 78. And as <hi>Solomon</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, <hi>When pride cometh, then cometh ſhame, Prov.</hi> 11. 2. but reprobates will ſtill live in this ſin, without repentance in this world: <hi>Ergo.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Touching the degrees of this their ſhame, I conceive that they ſhall be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to their degrees of ſinning in this world; as their ſins ſhall be more or leſſe, ſo ſhall their ſhame be; the greater ſinners amongſt them ſhall have the greater ſhame, and the leſſer ſinners amongſt them the leſſer ſhame in the world to come: And ſo I conceive, becauſe as every one of them ſhall bear his own iniquity, ſo every one of them ſhall ber his own ſhame, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. 16. 54. yet <hi>every one of them ſhall be filled with ſhame, Hab.</hi> 2. 6.</p>

               <p> Fourtthly, Touching the cauſes of this their ſhame, I ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the meritorious cauſe of it is, and ſhall be onely their ſin; for one ſin deſerves ſhame, and every ſin of it's own nature deſerves the ſhame of this world, and of that which is to come. And though it be true, that ſuch ſinners as have, or ſhall have their ſins pardoned, ſhall never be put to ſhame in the world to come; yet Reprobates (who ſhall never have their ſins pardoned, becauſe they will never repent in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) ſhall be ſure in the world to come to beare the whoſe ſhame which their ſins have deſerved, or ſhall deſerve.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the efficient cauſe of it ſhall be the whole Trinity, God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; for the ſame God that is now diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and offended with their ſins, is he that ſhall bring them to ſhame, and put them to ſhame, and fill their faces with ſhame in the world to come, as appears by the prayer of the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. 16, 17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the finall cauſe of it ſhall be the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Gods juſtice, he ſhall reward them with ſhame, that he may glorifie his Juſtice upon them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Touching the continuance of it; I ſay that this ſhame of theirs ſhall continue for ever in the world to come, for which cauſe it is ſaid, that their <hi>everlaſting confuſion ſhall never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, Jer.</hi> 20. 11. and their <hi>perpetuall ſhame ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </label> that are now effectually called, againſt the reproach and contempt of this wicked world: for ſuch of all others are moſt obnoxious to be contemned of the wicked, if for no other cauſe, yet for their graces and vertues, as our Saviour himſelf, though full of grace and vertue, was deſpiſed and contemned of many in this life; and the Apoſtles themſelves notwithſtanding their gracious converſation, were made the off-ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of all things: yea the godly complained of old, <hi>Our ſoul is exceedingly filled with the ſcorning of thoſe that are at eaſe, and with the contempt of the proud, Pſal.</hi> 103. 4. and <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>remove from me reproach and contempt, Pſal.</hi> 119. 22.

               <p>Again, this ſhould exhort all of us (that may be of Gods Elect, for ought we know to the contrary) to honour God to the moſt of our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity here in this world. Foraſmuch as,</p>

Having then ſuch examples before us, we ſhould be moved to make them our paterns.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We know that honour muſt be given, to whom honour is due; and honour is due to God, as he is our Creatour, as he is a Father, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. as he is a King; and in theſe reſpects we ſhould give honour unto him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He is worthy to receive all poſſible honour

               <p n="5">5. Unleſſe we honour him in this world, we have no reaſon to expect honor from him in that world which is to come.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But if we honour him in this, we ſhall be ſure to be honoured of him in that world, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promiſe, <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30.</p>
               <p>How muſt we honour him in this world?</p>
               <p n="1">1.

Pſal.</hi> 73. 25. as <hi>Paul</hi> had when he ſaid, <hi>O the depth of the wiſdome, and the knowledge of God, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 11. 33. without which honour none can be accepted, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29. 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt honour him in our bodies, by yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bodily ſubmiſſion and reverence unto him upon all occaſions, and by keeping our bodies pure and chaſt, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt honour him in our thoughts, words and actions, as at other times, ſo chiefly upon the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93010:116"/> Sabbath or Lords day, according to that charge of the Prophet, <hi>Thou ſhalt honour him, not doing thine own waies, nor finding thine own pleaſures, nor ſpeaking thine own words,</hi> Iſai. 58. 13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. VVe muſt honour him with our earthly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when we have occaſion and opportunity ſo to do; according to that of <hi>Solomon, Honor the Lord with thy ſubſtance, and with the firſt fruits of all thine increaſe, ſo ſhall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy preſſes ſhall burſt out with new wine, Prov.</hi> 3. 9. 10. Now I conceive that in theſe times men do give the Lord the firſt fruits of all their increaſe, when they do duly and conſcionably part with the tythes or tenths of all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe: and if ſo, then we may ſafely infer from hence, that they which duly and conſcionably part with their tythes, do honour the Lord with their ſubſtance, and may well hereupon expect a bleſſing from him, becauſe of this promiſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. VVe muſt honour him in this world above all others, above our ſelves, as our Saviour ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him above himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 54. above our earthly Kings, Parents, Children, &amp;c. for we know this was imputed as a ſin to <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt, that he <hi>honoured his ſons above God,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 29. the chiefeſt good muſt have the chiefeſt honour, and we acknowledge him to be our chiefeſt good, therefore we muſt honour him above others.</p>
               <p>The latter Propoſition is, <hi>That reprobates ſhall</hi>

               <p>The certainty of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, touching the nature of it. I conceive that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93010:117"/> to be contemned, is all one, as to be lightly or lowly eſteemed of, and ſo the word is interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Scripture, as whereas <hi>Ieſurun</hi> contemned God, it is ſaid that he <hi>lightly eſteemed the rock of his ſalvation, Deut.</hi> 32. 15. and whereas the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be contemned if they repent not, it is ſaid, <hi>they ſhall be lightly eſteemed,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. So then, when I ſay that Reprobates ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned in the world to come, I underſtand that they ſhall be lightly eſteemed of in the world to come, on Gods part, and Chriſts part, amongſt the Angells, amongſt the Saints, and amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>They ſhall be lightly eſteemed of on Gods part in the world to come, for he ſhall eſteeme them for no other, then reprobates, caſt-awayes, curſed children, children of the devill, children of wrath, and heirs of perdition.</p>
               <p>They ſhall be lightly eſteemed of on Chriſts part, for he ſhall have the ſame eſteem of them, which his Father ſhall have in the world to come.</p>
               <p>They ſhall be lightly eſteemed of amongſt the good Angells, who have no good eſteem of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners in this world, ſuch as think they need no repentance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. and if ſo, we may wel think that they ſhall have a very light eſteem of reprobates in the world to come.</p>
               <p>They ſhall have a light eſteem amongſt evill Angells, who have no great eſteem of impenitent ſinners in this world, as may appear by that ſpeech of Satan to thoſe Conjurers, <hi>Ieſus I know, and</hi> Paul <hi>I know, but who are ye, Acts</hi> 19. 15. and if ſo, then we may vvell think that they ſhall have a very light eſteem of Reprobates in the world to come.</p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:93010:117"/>
               <p> They ſhall be lightly eſteemed of amongſt the Saints, for the Saints in this world contemn a vile perſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4. and if ſo, then vve may vvell think, that they ſhall have a very light eſteem of Reprobates in the world to come.</p>
               <p>They ſhall be lightly eſteemed of amongſt themſelves, for though wicked men may ſeem to honour one another in this vvorld very much in time of proſperity; yet in time of diſtreſſe they ſeem to be regardleſſe one of another, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by that ſpeech of the chief Prieſts and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders unto <hi>Judas</hi> vvhen he vvas diſtreſſe and ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned in betraying the innocent blood,</hi> for they ſaid unto him, <hi>what is that to us? ſee thou to that, Mat.</hi> 27. 4. and if vvicked men do no more regard one another here in time of diſtreſſe, vve may vvell think that Reprobates ſhall have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light eſteem one of another in the world to come; thus may we underſtand the nature of this their contempt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, touching the certainty of it, I affirm that reprobates ſhall moſt certainly be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and deſpiſed in the world to come, as may appear by theſe arguments.</p>
               <p>1. They that are veſſells of diſhonor, ſhall be contemned and deſpiſed in the world to come, but reprobates are veſſells of diſhonor, for which cauſe they are compared unto ſuch veſſells of a potter as are made for diſhonor, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 21. and unto ſuch veſſels in a great houſe as are made for diſhonor and contempt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. They that will ſtill deſpiſe, and contemne God in this world, ſhall be contemned and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the world to come, as the Lord ſaid, <hi>Eli;</hi>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:93010:118"/> 
                  <hi>They that deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly eſteemed,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. but reprobates will ſtill deſpiſe and contemn God in this world: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that ſhall have their names left for a curſe in the world to come, ſhall be contemned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed in that world; but reprobates ſhall have their names left for a curſe to Gods choſen in that world, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65. 15. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. They that will ſtill be wicked in this world, ſhall be contemned and deſpiſed in the world to come, according to that of <hi>Solomon, When the wicked cometh, then cometh contempt, Prov.</hi> 18. 3. but reprobates will ſtill be wicked in this world: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. They that will ſtill be proud and live under the dominion of this ſin without repentance, ſhall be contemned and deſpiſed in the world to come, as the Prophet intimates when he ſaith, <hi>God beholded the proud afar off, Pſal.</hi> 138. 6. a ſign of preſent &amp; future contempt, but reprobates wil will ſtill be proud, and live under the dominion of this ſin without repentance: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. They that will ſtill be of a perverſe heart in this world, ſhall be contemned and deſpiſed in the world to come, according to that of <hi>Solomon, He that is of a perverſe heart shall be deſpiſed, Pro.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>viz.</hi> not only in this world, but alſo in the world to come, if he continue ſuch an one: Now reprobates will ſtill be of a perverſe heart in this world: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. They that ſhall riſe again to contempt at the generall Reſurrection, ſhall be contemned and deſpiſed in the world to come, but reprobates ſhall riſe again to contempt, at the generall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:93010:118"/>
               <p> 8. They that ſhall be put to everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach in the world to come, ſhall be contemned and deſpiſed in that world, but reprobates ſhall be put to everlaſting reproach in that world, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 40. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this latter Propoſition, doth not only <label type="milestone">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>ſhall be at liberty in the world to come;</hi> that is to ſay, they ſhall be at liberty from the wrath of God, and from all the effects and fruits thereof in that world; and ſo much may be made good by ſundry Arguments. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Prophecie, or propheticall promiſe is pregnant for it, where he ſaith, <hi>The creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God, Rom.</hi> 8. 21. Where by the children of God, I underſtand his elect children, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 52. who for the preſent are not all his adopted children, but ſhall be in due time; and by the liberty of theſe I underſtand a liberty from the wrath of God, and from all the effects and fruits of it, becauſe it is ſuch a liberty as the creature it ſelfe ſhall partake of, and I know no liberty but this, that the creature here mentioned ſhall partake of, and it is called <hi>glorious liberty,</hi> for to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from the liberty which the children of God injoy in this world, which is not glorious liberty, as that in the world to come ſhall be; yea, it may be called glorious liberty, becauſe it ſhall be perfect and compleat, and perfect things ſhall be glorious, as perfect peace ſhall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous peace, perfect holineſſe, glorious holineſſe, ſo perfect liberty ſhall be glorious liberty: And whereas it's ſaid, that the creature it ſelf ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into this liberty, I underſtand by the creature it

               <p n="2">2. They that ſhall never be afflicted in the world to come in ſoul, body, name, or eſtate, ſhall be at liberty from the wrath of God in that world: Now Gods Elect ſhall never be afflicted in that world any manner of way, in ſoul, body, name or eſtate, as I gather from that Promiſe which ſaith, <hi>God ſhall wipe all tears from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more paine, Rev.</hi> 21. 4.

               <p> Which Propoſition thus confirmed, may be uſefull thus;</p>
               <p>Firſt, it makes for the confutation of ſuch as promiſe themſelves and others a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect liberty in this world, as ſome ſeducers in their Pamphlets have lately done, who ſay that <note place="margin">Mr. H. A.</note> the time of perfect liberty either is come, or is neer at hand to be injoyed in this world, when the godly ſhall neither ſin themſelves, nor feel any more fruits or effects of Gods anger, and diſpleaſure for ſin; but I may ſay of ſuch as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of Sectaries in the latter times, <hi>Whileſt they promiſe liberty to others, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are the ſervants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the ſame is he brought in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. So we find by ſad experience that theſe men are in bondage to corruption, whileſt they promiſe a ſtate of perfect liberty to others.</p>
               <p>Indeed I acknowledge a ſpirituall liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the adopted children of God in this world, That,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are at liberty from the rigor of the Law, in as much as God doth not expect perfect obedience from them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are at liberty from the curſe of the Law, in as much as Chriſt was made a curſe for them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are at liberty from the ceremonies of the Law, in as much as they are not bound to obſerve them, for which cauſe they ſhould ſtand faſt in this liberty, wherewith Chriſt hath made them free, that they be not intangled again with the yoke of bondage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:93010:122"/>
               <p> And I acknowledge that Chriſt hath purchaſed a ſtate of perfect liberty to be injoyed by all Gods Elect in the world to come, as hath been proved; but that they ſhall injoy ſuch an eſtate of perfect liberty from ſin, and from the wrath of God in this life, is utterly denyed, by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Writers: For how can they have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect liberty from ſinne in this wold, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are in danger of ſinning daily as long as they live here? <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 20. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 3. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 8. And how can they have a perfect liberty in this life from the wrath of God, ſeeing God is angry and diſpleaſed with them for every offence? As <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant of the Lord ſinned, and GOD was angry with him for it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 37. <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> the Saint of the Lord ſinned, and God was angry with him for it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 20. The Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites ſinned, and Gods anger was kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them for it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 1. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and God was angry with him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 9. Wherefore let not any confound this world with that which is to come, nor dream of ſuch a ſtate of perfect liberty here, as onely belongs to the world to come.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſhould perſwade all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to bear with godly patience their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent experience of Gods wrath, anger, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure for ſin; ſeeing there will come a ſtate of perfect liberty for them, they ſhould in the mean while poſſeſſe their ſouls with patience, eſpecially conſidering, 1. That our preſent experience of his wrath is no more then what we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, we ſhould reſolve with the Prophet,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93010:122"/> 
                  <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord becauſe I have ſinned, Micah</hi> 7. 9. 2. That our preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his wrath is leſſe then we have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. 3. That though God be angry with every ſin, yet he is ſlow to execute his anger, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 8. 4. That though he hath executed his anger up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, yet upon our unfained repentance he will cauſe it to ceaſe from us again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 8.

               <p>Firſt, touching the certainty of it, Iaver it for a moſt certain truth, that Gods Elect ſhall have dominion over reprobates in the world to come, as may be made good by theſe arguments and conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is ſaid of ſuch wicked rich men as ſhall not truly repent, and be converted before their death, <hi>That the upright ſhall have dominion over them in the morning,</hi> Pſal. 49. 14. where by the upright I underſtand Gods Elect; who are, or ſhal be all upright and ſincere before God, and knowne by that name another day; and by the Morning I underſtand the day of the laſt Reſurrection, which ſhall be as a morning, both in reſpect of ſuch as ſhall then ariſe from the ſleep of death; and in reſpect of that everlaſting day which ſhal have no evening: and ſo from this place I may argue thus, They that ſhall begin to have dominion over reprobates at the laſt Reſurrection here called the Morning, ſhal have dominion over them in the world to come: Now Gods Elect here called the upright, ſhall begin to have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over reprobates at the laſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection here called the Morning: <hi>Ergo.</hi> they ſhall have dominion over them in that world.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:93010:125"/> 2. It ſhould be conſidered that Gods Elect ſhal be Kings in the world to come, not only in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual &amp; myſtical ſenſe as now they are, but in a more genuine &amp; proper ſenſe; becauſe Chriſt hath made them <hi>Kings unto God, Rev.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 10. that is, in ſubordination unto God to ſerve him in a Kingly way; their Kingſhip ſhal never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed. From whence I may argue thus, they that ſhall be Kings in the world to come, ſhall have dominion in that world, either over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or over their fellow brethren and Saints, or over reprobates: now Gods Elect ſhal be Kings in that world, yet ſhall not have dominion over themſelves in that world, becauſe they shal have no vicious qualities or corruptions in themſelves there to be ſubdued; neither shal they have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over their fellow brethren and Saints, who shal be as truly Kings as themſelves: <hi>Ergo,</hi> They shal have dominion over reprobates in that world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It should be conſidered that Gods Elect shal be Princes in the world to come properly ſo called, as I gather from that prophecy concerning Chriſt, <hi>Instead of thy fathers ſhall be thy children, whom thou mayeſt make Princes in all the earth, Pſal.</hi> 45. 17. VVhere by all the earth, I underſtand not this corrupt earth; as if Gods Elect should be all Princes in it; but the new earth, or the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table part of that new vvorld vvhich shal be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated inſtead of this, wherein they shal be Princes indeed: and ſo from hence I may reaſon thus, if Gods Elect shal be Princes in the world to come, then they they shall have dominion in that vvorld, either over themſelves, or over
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93010:125"/> their fellow brethren and Saints, or over repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; but they ſhal be Princes in that world, and ſhall not have dominion over themſelves, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their fellow brethren and Saints, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before given: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they ſhall have domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over reprobates in that world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is promiſed that Gods Elect ſhall reigne with Chriſt in the world to come, <hi>If we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>And we ſhall reign on the earth, Rev.</hi> 5. 10. that is, on the new earth, the habitable part of the world to come. From whence I may reaſon thus alſo, if they ſhal reign with Chriſt in the world to come, then they ſhal reign either over themſelves, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their fellow brethren and Saints, or over re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates; but they ſhall reign with Chriſt in that world, and they ſhall not reign over themſelves, nor over their fellow brethren and Saints: <hi>Ergo,</hi> They ſhall reign over reprobates in that world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It ſhould be conſidered, that Gods Elect in the world to come ſhall have power over Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as it is written, <hi>He that overcometh and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the Nations, Rev.</hi> 2. 26. where by Nations I underſtand ſuch at the later day, as ſhal be found to have been the reprobate ſort of all Nations in this world. And if in this ſenſe Gods Elect in the world to come ſhal have power over Nations, then doubtleſſe they ſhould have dominion over Reprobates in that world. But in this ſenſe they ſhal have power over Nations in that world. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. It ſhould be conſidered, that Gods Elect in the world to come ſhal have authority over divers cities. For, our Saviour ſhall ſay unto one faithful
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93010:126"/> ſervant, <hi>Have thou authority over ten cities:</hi> and to another, <hi>Have thou authority over five cities, Luke</hi> 19. 17, 19. Where by cities I underſtand ſuch at the later day, as ſhal be found to have been the reprobate ſort of divers Cities in this world, as of Sodome and Gomorrah, Corazin, Bethſaida, Capernaum, Babylon, &amp;c. and if in this ſenſe Gods elect in the world to come ſhall have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over divers Cities, then doubtleſſe they ſhall have dominion over reprobates in that world; but in this ſenſe they ſhall have authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over divers Cities: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. They that ſhall judge reprobates in the world to come by way of atteſtation or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, ſhall have dominion over them in this reſpect in that world; but Gods Elect ſhall judge reprobates in that world, both reprobate Men, and reprobate Angells, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2, 3. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. They that ſhall puniſh reprobates in the world to come, and execute judgements upon them, ſhall have dominion over them in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in that world; but Gods Elect ſhall puniſh reprobates in the world to come, and execute judgements upon them, as it is written, <hi>Let a two-edged ſword be in their hand, to execute vengeance upon the Heathen, and puniſhments upon the people, to bind their Kings with chains, and their Nobles with fetters of iron, to execute on them the judgments decreed, Pſal.</hi> 149. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. They that ſhall captivate reprobates in the world to come, and rule over them, ſhall have dominion over them in that world; but Gods Elect ſhall captivate reprobates in the world to come, and rule over them, as it is written, <hi>they ſhal</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="10">10. They that ſhall have dominion in the world to come under the whole heaven, ſhall have dominion over reprobates in that world; but Gods Elect ſhall have dominion in the world to come under the whole heaven, according to that of the Prophet <hi>Daniel, And the Kingdome and dominion, and the greatneſſe of the Kingdome under the whole heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt high, Dan.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. They that ſhall have reprobates ſubdued unto them in the world to come, and brought under their feet, ſhall have dominion over them in that world; but Gods Elect in the world to come ſhall have reprobates ſubdued unto them, and brought under their feet, as it is written, <hi>He ſhall ſubdue the people under us, and the Nations under our feet, Pſal.</hi> 47. 3. yea, ſaith the Lord, they ſhall <hi>lick up the duſt of thy feet, Eſa.</hi> 49. 23. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. If Gods Elect in the world to come ſhal impoſe ſervice upon reprobates, and ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſuch to ſerve them, then they ſhal have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them in that world: but Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in the world to come ſhall impoſe ſervice on ſuch, and ſhall compell ſuch to ſerve them, as I gather from that of the Prophet. <hi>And the people ſhall take them and bring them to their place, &amp; the houſe of Iſrael ſhal poſſeſſe them in the land of the Lord for ſervants &amp; handmaids, Iſa.</hi> 14. 2. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, touching the nature of this domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I affirme:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the dominion of Gods Elect over re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93010:127"/> in the world to come, ſhal be a dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive dominion, ſuch as ſhal be given them from God, and from Chriſt; for there is no cauſe to be found in them in reſpect of their nature or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, why they ſhould have dominion over them, but this dominion ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt High, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27. and Chriſt ſhall give them power over the Nations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this dominion of theirs ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the dominion of God, and of Chriſt; for God ſhall reign over reprobates in the world to come by his eſſentiall power, and Chriſt ſhall reign over them by his perſonall humane power; but the Saints ſhall reign over them only by way of ſubordination, or delegation, as Vicegerents, or D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>puties under Chriſt; for which cauſe they are called Kings unto God, that is, in ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this dominion of theirs ſhal not be an abſolute, but a limited dominion, that is to ſay, they ſhal not reign over reprobates according to their own wil and pleaſure, but according to the decree, wil, &amp; pleaſure of God in Chriſt, they ſhal execute on them the judgments decreed, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 149. 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That this dominion of theirs ſhal be ful of hardſhip and ſeverity as the ſtrict juſtice of God ſhal require, for which cauſe it is ſaid, that they ſhall rule them with a two-edged ſword, with a rod of iron, and ſhal bind their Kings in chains and their Nobles with fetters of iron; that is to ſay, they ſhall exerciſe their power over repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in the world to come, with much hardſhip and ſeverity.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:93010:127"/> 5. That this dominion of theirs ſhall be both common and ſpeciall; common to all, overall, and ſpeciall to ſome, over ſome; for all Gods Elect ſhal have this Kingly power overall repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates where ever they find them in the world to come, and yet ſome of them ſhall have a more ſpeciall dominion over ſome reprobates, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver others.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That this dominion of theirs ſhall continue for ever over ſuch, as I gather from that of the Prophet, <hi>The Saints of the most high ſhall take the kingdome, and ſhall poſſeſſe the kingdome for ever, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for ever, and ever, Dan.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
               <p>Which Propoſition thus cleared, may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It makes for the confutation of ſuch as plead hard for a temporall dominion of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> all Saints overall the wicked and reprobate ſort in this life; which conceit is much cried up by all ſorts of Millenaries in theſe dayes for a great myſtery, and ſome of them ſay, that the time is now come wherein the Saints muſt take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all the Kingdomes upon earth, and muſt rule the wicked and reprobate ſort in them with a two-edged ſword, and a rod of iron, and muſt bind their Kings with chains, and their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles with fetters of iron, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But I would have theſe deluded Brethren at length to underſtand, that this conceit of theirs is firſt contrary to Scripture, becauſe that dominion over the wicked which the Scripture promiſeth to the Saints, is not a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall dominion to be injoyed in this world, but an eternall dominion to be injoyed in the world
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93010:128"/> to come, as hath been before ſhewed. Secondly, that it is contrary to reaſon; for if Gods Elect in this life cannot diſcern reprobates from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it is againſt reaſon to think that they ſhall have dominion over them in this life; but they cannot by all their skill diſcern reprobates from others while they live here, therefore it is againſt reaſon to think that they ſhall have dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them in this world. Thirdly, that it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to daily experience; for we find by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that Gods Elect in this world do for the moſt part live under the dominion of others; either they live under the dominion of lawfull Kings, Princes, and Rulers, or elſe under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of wicked Tyrants, and Uſurpers, and ſtill they importune the Throne of grace for ſuch as are ſet in authority over them, that under them they may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſty: Is it not then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to daily experience, to think that all the Saints ſhall have dominion over all the wicked in this world? Yes: And if this Millenary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple ſhall once be generally aſſented unto, which God forbid, then the next queſtion will be, Who ſhall be taken for Saints and fit perſons to have dominion? And who ſhall be taken for wicked ones or reprobates worthy to be under domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this world? Which queſtion without doubt will occaſion as hot a diſpute, and as mortall a controverſie as ever was in the world: Wherefore away with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of a temporall dominion of Saints in this world, let Profeſſors be aſhamed to owne it.</p>

It may inform us of a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the condition of Gods elect in this world, and in that which is to come; for in this world they may poſſibly be made ſervants and ſlaves to wicked men and reprobates, and as ſlaves may be judged, puniſhed, impriſoned, oppreſſed, bought and ſold by them, according to that of <hi>Solomon, Folly is ſet in great dignity, and the rich ſit in low place: I have ſeen ſervants upon horſes, and Princes walking as ſervants upon the earth, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 10. 6, 7. But it ſhall not thus be with them in the world to come, becauſe in that world they ſhall be ſo far from being ſervants and ſlaves to wicked men, and reprobates, that they ſhall be Lords and Kings, and Rulers over them, and ſhall execute judgement and vengeance upon them; wherefore they ſhould be contented to ſuffer any ſervitude in this world that is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably put upon them, conſidering what lordſhip they ſhall have in that which is to come.</p>

                  </label> informe us, that reprobates ſhall gain nothing at the laſt by their Lordſhip and dominion over
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93010:130"/> others in this world. I do not ſay, they are all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates who have dominion over others in this world; for it is Gods Ordinance in that ſome ſhall have dominion, that ſome ſhall command, and others obey, that ſome ſhall rule, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be ruled, and ſometimes godly men, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wicked men are called in a lawfull way to rule over others both in Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: Yea, beſides theſe there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Uſurpers who exerciſe Authority, Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and Juriſdiction over others by their commands, threats, and penalties, without a lawfull calling, but put the caſe, that any wicked perſons after they have domineered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver others in this world, ſhall die without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſo be found reprobates at the later day? what then ſhall they gain by their Lordſhip and dominion over others in this world?</p>
               <p>Surely nothing at all, but they ſhall be loſers by it, and ſhall be made ſlaves for it for ever: yea, according to their advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, ſhall be their abaſement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, according to their dominion here, ſhall be their ſlavery hereafter; wherefore, if we deſire not to be ſlaves to Gods Elect in the world to come, we muſt repent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly while we live here, as of other ſinnes, ſo of our tyranny over others; and we muſt take heed how we <hi>lord it over Gods heritage</hi> here; for it cannot be ſafe for us to lord it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch as ſhal be our Lords and Maſters in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Yet many in theſe daies are very ambitions of Lordſhip and dominion of others, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Indeed they that have right to this Government by the Law of God and Man, may lawfully deſire it; but why ſhould others deſire it, who have no ſuch right at all unto it? Surely theſe men are right of <hi>Abſaloms</hi> ſpirit, and every one of them ſaith in his heart, as he ſometimes ſaid, <hi>Oh! that I were made Judge in the Land, that every man which hath any ſuit or cauſe, might come unto me, and I would do him justice,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 4. but <hi>Abſaloms</hi> ambition was well rewarded when he was hanged as a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the Forreſt: and the ambition of theſe alſo will be well rewarded, if ever they ſhal come to preach their late repentance at Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne, or if ever they ſhall come to be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in chaines under darkneſſe, or if ever they ſhall come to be ſlaves to Gods Elect; which things may ſpeedily befall them unleſſe they repent.</p>
               <p>In the meane while, I had rather my ſoul ſhould be ſubject to the powers that are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God, then that it ſhould deſire a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power over Nations. I had rather be a Subject, then a Soveraigne in this world, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the burthen of ſubjection and the danger too, to be far leſſe then that of Soveraignty; and

                  </note> 
                  <hi>ſhall have a rich estate in the world to come;</hi> for clearing whereof, we muſt underſtand that the rich eſtate of Gods Elect in the world to come, is deſcribed two waies in the Word of God, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. By the name of an Inheritance: for in Chriſt (as the Apoſtle ſaith in the name of the Elect) we have obtained an inheritance, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 11. that is, the right of inheritance, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:93010:131"/> this inheritance is ſaid to be incorruptible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. It is ſaid to be immortall, becauſe it cannot die away out of the name, as a temporall inheritance may. It is ſaid to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, becauſe it cannot be defiled and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſin in the getting, keeping, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of it, as a temporall inheritance may be; neither can it fade away and be brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; as a temporall inheritance may be; neither is it reſerved for the Elect in corrupt earth, to be poſſeſſed and enjoyed by them in this world; but it is reſerved for them in heaven, to be poſſeſſed and enjoyed by them in the world to come: and we may conceive that this inheritance of theirs ſhall be of large extent, becauſe the Scripture ſpeaks of divers things which they ſhall inherit in the world to come, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſhall inherit the Kingdome prepared for them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 32. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 30.</p>
               <p>They ſhall inherit a Crowne, called a Crovvn of righteouſneſſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. and a Crowne of Life, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p>They ſhall inherit glory, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 35. the glory before deſcribed.</p>
               <p>They ſhall inherit the bleſſing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
               <p>They ſhall inherit the promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12.</p>
               <p>They ſhall inherit a reward for vvhat they have done and ſuffered in obedience to Gods vvill, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
               <p>They ſhall inherit all good things, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover, their eſtate of inheritance is deſcribed by the name of riches; and the riches of the vvorld to come are called,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:93010:132"/> 
                  <hi>Durable riches, Prov.</hi> 8. 18. Becauſe they ſhall be more durable then temporall riches are, and ſhall endure for ever. <hi>Precious riches, Prov.</hi> 24. 4. Becauſe they ſhall be farre more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then any temporall riches can be. <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant riches, Prov.</hi> 24. 4. Becauſe they ſhall be more pleaſant to the injoyers, then tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall riches can be. <hi>True riches, Luke</hi> 16. 11. becauſe they ſhall afford more truth of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent then any temporall riches can. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 8. Becauſe the worth and value of them cannot in this life be ſearched out unto perfection, as the value of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall riches may; for there is none ſo rich in this world, in reſpect of his earthly ſubſtance, but he may by himſelfe or his friends ſearch out the fartheſt end of his wealth, and may know what his outward eſtate is worth to be bought or ſold; but the Riches of which I ſpeake cannot be thus ſerrched out in this life, ſeeing <hi>here we know but in part, and prophecy in part,</hi> and they are called the <hi>Riches of Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 8. Becauſe they ſhall be none other but ſuch as Chriſt hath purchaſed with his moſt precious bloud.</p>
               <p>So from both theſe deſcriptions I may infer, <hi>That the the rich eſtate of Gods Elect in the world to come, ſhall be a rich inheritance.</hi> And that they ſhall have ſuch a rich inheritance in the vvorld to come, may be thus proved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they ſhall have unſearchable riches in the vvorld to come, ſuch as Chriſt hath purchaſed for them, ſhall have a rich eſtate or inheritance in that vvorld.</p>

               <p>But Gods Elect are, or ſhall be rich in faith in this life; as may appear by that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Hath not God choſen the poor of this world rich in faith? Iam.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

And we find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, 1. That theſe outward riches are uncertain riches, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. 2. That they are deceitful riches, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 22. 3. That they cannot make a
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:93010:134"/> man truly happy or bleſſed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 15. 4. That they profit nothing in the day of Gods wrath, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 4. 5. That they come alike to all, to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and to the wicked, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 2. 6. That where they are not ſanctified, they hinder the Salvation of many. <hi>How hardly ſhall they that have riches en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of God? Luk.</hi> 18. 24. And where they are not ſanctified, they haſten and further the deſtruction of many; according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>They that will be rich fall into temptation and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition, Tim.</hi> 6. 9. But on the contrary, they ſhould prefer the riches of the World to come, and ſet their hearts upon them, conſidering that the riches of that world ſhall be far more certain, more true, more durable, more precious and more pleaſant, then the riches of this can be, as was ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>The other Propoſition is, <hi>That Reprobates ſhall</hi>

                  <hi>have a poor estate in the World to come:</hi> which may be thus confirmed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They that have no riches purchaſed for them to be enjoyed in the World to come, ſhall have a poor eſtate in that world: but Reprobates have no riches purchaſed for them to be enjoyed in the world to come: <hi>Ergo,</hi> They ſhall have a poor eſtate in that world.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p> And this latter Propoſition thus confirmed, may be <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> uſeful too: As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It may inform us, <hi>That none ſhould envy the prosperity of wicked men in this world, ſo as to grudg and be grieved at it:</hi> And that for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is no new thing to hear of worldly wealth and riches conferred on the wicked ſort in this world: For ſcoffing <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Nabal,</hi> had a large portion of worldly wealth conferred on them; and our Saviour ſpeaks of a fooliſh man, who had ſuch an increaſe of worldly wealth, that he knew not what to do with it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 17. and curſed <hi>Dives</hi> was ſo rich in worldly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that he was <hi>clothed in purple, and fine linnen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day, Luk.</hi> 16. 19. Yea it is ordinary at this day to find the wicked ſort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the richer ſort of this world: And if this be no new thing, we have the leſs cauſe to grudg and murmur at it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is by the hand of divine Providence that the wicked ſort are made rich in this world: <hi>For the Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich; he bringeth low, and lifteth up,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 7. He it is <hi>that filleth their bellies with his hid treaſure, Pſal.</hi> 17. 14. Now the Lord is a free Diſpenſator, and may do with his own as pleaſeth him: And why ſhould our eye be evil, becauſe his is good?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The worldly wealth of the wicked is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at leaſt a Judgment of God upon them; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>Solomon: There is a ſore evil which I have ſeen under the Sun, namely riches, kept for the owners thereof to their hurt, Eccl.</hi> 5. 13. And why should we envy the Judgment of God upon them?</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:93010:136"/> 4. The worldly wealth of the wicked is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at leaſt curſed unto them: For <hi>God doth curſe them in their basket, and in their ſtore, in the fruit of their land, in the increaſe of their kine, and the flocks of their ſheep, Deut.</hi> 28. 17, 18. And why should we envy the Curſe of God upon them?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The worldly wealth of the wicked may be of short continuance, and be ſoon taken from them; according to that of the Prophet: <hi>I have ſeen the wicked in great power, and ſpreading himſelf like a green bay-tree: Yet he paſſed away, and lo, he was not; yea, I ſought him, but he could not be found, Pſal.</hi> 37. 35, 36. Though <hi>they have ſwallowed down riches, yet they ſhall vomit them up again; God ſhall cast them out of their belly, Job</hi> 20. 15. Or their <hi>riches may periſh by evil travel, Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 14. And why should we envy their short proſperity?</p>
               <p n="6">6. The worldly wealth of the wicked may fall by inheritance unto the godly, and to ſuch as shall make a good uſe thereof; according to that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: The wealth of the ſinner is laid up for the just, Prov.</hi> 13. 22. And <hi>he that by uſury, and unjust gain, increaſeth his ſubstance, he ſhall gather it for him that will pitty the poor, Prov.</hi> 28. 8. And if ſo, we have the leſs cauſe to grudg at their wealth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is poſſible that ſome, yea many wicked rich perſons may be brought to repentance before their death, and ſo may honour the Lord with their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as well as others: And if ſo, then we shall have more cauſe to rejoyce then to grieve, for that they are, or have been, ſo rich in this world.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But ſuppoſe the worſt, that many or any wicked rich perſons shal never be brought to repentance, but shall dye out of Gods favour, and ſo be found Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates
<pb facs="tcp:93010:136"/> in the world to come; what then? Surely then, wo shall be unto them; according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Wo unto you that are rich, for you have received your conſolation, Luk.</hi> 6. 24. Then they shall wish that they had never been rich in this world; then they shall be brought into a very poor eſtate and condition: yea, then they shall not only be countable to God for their riches, according to that in the Parable, <hi>Give account of thy ſtewardſhip;</hi> but alſo shall be punished for the abuſe of them; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of S. <hi>James: Go too now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miſeries that ſhall come upon you: Your riches are corrupted, and your garments moth-eaten: Your gold and ſilver is cankered, and the rust of them ſhall be a witneſs against you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire; ye have heaped treaſure together for the laſt days, Jam.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered, I ſee no reaſon why any should grudg at the proſperity of wicked rich men in this world, ſeeing that the Reprobate ſort of them shall have a very poor eſtate in the world to come: But I infer with the Prophet; <hi>Fret not thy ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of evill doers, neither be thou envious againſt the workers of iniquity; for they ſhal ſoon be cut down like the graſſe, and wither as the green herb, Pſal.</hi> 73. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we wil not be (as none deſires to be) poor with Reprobates in the world to come; we muſt labour to be poor in Spirit, and rich in grace while we live in this world; for if we be poor in Spirit here in this life, we shall not be poor in the world to come, as we may gather from that of our Saviour, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven, Mat.</hi> 5. 3. And if we be
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:93010:137"/> rich in grace, that is, in knowledg faith, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, love, and hope, &amp;c. we ſhall not be poor in the World to come; as we may gather from that of Saint <hi>James: Hath not God choſen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he hath promiſed to them that love him? Jam.</hi> 2. 5.</p>

               <p>HEre followeth an eighth ſpecial Difference, which ſhall be betwixt the parties before named in the World to come; which may be thus expreſſed:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gods Elect ſhall have Peace in the World</hi>

                  <hi>Reprobates ſhall have Tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bulation to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former Propoſition is, <hi>That Gods Elect</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>ſhall have Peace in the World to come:</hi> which Peace of theirs is to be conſidered:</p>
               <p>As touching <hi>the Nature of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching <hi>the Certainty of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching <hi>the Nature of it,</hi> I affirm,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That their Peace in the World to come ſhall be great Peace;</hi> According to that promiſe: <hi>Great ſhall be the Peace of thy Children, Iſai.</hi> 54. 13. which promiſe may be performed partly in this world, and partly in Heaven: but it ſhall be perfectly performed only in the world to come;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:93010:137"/> wherein the peace of <hi>Gods Elect</hi> shall be great for variety, and great for excellency.</p>
               <p>Their peace ſhall be great for variety; becauſe in that world,</p>
               <p>They ſhall have peace with God: God ſhall be no enemy unto them, neither ſhall he lay any thing to their charge; but ſhall be more fully reconciled unto them, in reſpect of manifeſtation, then now he is.</p>
               <p>They ſhall have peace with Chriſt: for Chriſt ſhall be no Enemy unto them, neither ſhall he lay any thing to their charge in that world; but ſhall own them for his <hi>Friends,</hi> his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> his <hi>Love,</hi> his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſhall have peace with their Conſciences: Their Conſciences ſhall not accuſe nor trouble them for any ſin, for any thing; but as they ſhall have boldneſs at the day of Judgment, ariſing from peace of Conſcience, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 18. ſo this peace ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill.</p>
               <p>They ſhall have peace among themſelves; that is, they ſhall worſhip and ſerve God peaceably toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with one minde, and with one heart; and ſo <hi>there ſhall be one Lord, and his Name one, Zech.</hi> 14. 9. becauſe the Elect shall worship onely one Lord, and that with one kinde of worship, and with one heart, and one Soul, in that world.</p>
               <p>They shall have peace from the <hi>Angels:</hi> for as the <hi>good Angels</hi> shall have no <hi>will,</hi> ſo the <hi>evil Angels</hi> shall have no <hi>power,</hi> to hurt or moleſt them; as we may gather from that Promiſe, <hi>The God of peace ſhall bruiſe Satan under your feet ſhortly, Rom.</hi> 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>They shall have peace from wicked men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:93010:138"/> for though the Saints shall have power to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and trouble the wicked, yet the wicked shall have no power to moleſt and trouble the Saints in that world, ſeeing they shall be <hi>bound in chains, Pſal.</hi> 149. 7.</p>
               <p>They ſhall have peace from all other creatures in that world; as it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt be in league with the ſtones of the field, and the beasts of the field ſhall be at peace with thee; and thou ſhalt know that thy Tabernacle ſhall be in peace, Job</hi> 5. 23, 24. Again, it is ſaid, <hi>The Wolf and the Lamb ſhall feed together, and the Lion ſhall eat ſtraw like the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock; and duſt ſhall be the Serpents meat: They ſhall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy Mountain, ſaith the Lord, Iſa.</hi> 65. 25. Which prophetical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſhall never be perfectly fulfilled in this world, but they ſhall be ſo fulfilled in that which is to come: Such ſhall be the peace of Gods Elect in that world.</p>
               <p>And as this peace of theirs ſhall be great for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety; ſo it ſhall be great for excellency: in as much as the excellency of it ſhall far ſurpaſs all that we can, now in our mortal condition, think or ſpeak of it. And if there be any peace of God out of God, belonging to any creature, <hi>which paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> as it ſhould ſeem there is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7. ſurely this ſhall be ſuch a peace. And who knows not that the peace of this world is more obvious to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent apprehenſion and underſtanding, then that of the world to come?</p>
               <p n="2">2. I affirm, That this peace of theirs ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant for meaſure and degree; as it is promiſed, <hi>They ſhall delight themſelves in the abundance of peace, Pſal.</hi> 37. 11. <hi>And God ſhall extend peace to</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:93010:138"/> 
                  <hi>them like a river, Iſai.</hi> 66. 12. Which Promiſes ſhall perfectly be fulfilled, not in this world, but in that which is to come.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I affirm, That this peace of theirs ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, without defect; as the Prophet aſſures us, when he ſaith unto God, <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe minde is ſtayed on thee, Iſa.</hi> 26. 3. The beſt peace which can be had in this world, may be in ſome reſpect defective; but in that which is to come, the peace of Gods choſen ſhall be in nothing defective, but they ſhall have ſo much of it as their hearts can wiſh or deſire to have.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I affirm, That this peace of theirs ſhall be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, without end: For which cauſe it is ſaid, <hi>That God ſhall keep them in perfect peace,</hi> in the former place, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. 3. without any limitation of time; to intimate, That he ſhall keep them in this peace for ever: And the Covenant of peace, which he hath made with his choſen, is called <hi>an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, Ezek.</hi> 37. 26. And if this Covenant be everlaſting, then ſurely the peace, which they ſhall enjoy by virtue of this Covenant, ſhall be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting too: And ſo we have ſeen the nature of this peace.</p>
               <p>As touching <hi>the Certainty of it,</hi> I aver it for a moſt certain truth, That Gods Elect ſhall have peace in the world to come; ſuch a peace as hath been deſcribed: as may be proved by theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</p>
               <p n="1">1. They that ſhall be perfectly reconciled to God in the world to come, ſhall have perfect peace in that world, perfect peace being a fruit of perfect recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation: But Gods Elect ſhall be perfectly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto him in the World to come, becauſe they

Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: But Gods Elect ſhall be perfectly juſtified in the world to come, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19. becauſe they are, have been, or ſhall be, truly juſtified in this world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They that are wont to have their mindes ſtay'd on God in this world, ſo as to be ſtedfaſt towards him, in reſpect of graces received, and truths recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and in reſpect of well doing, &amp;c. ſhall have perfect peace in the world to come; according to that of the Prophet, <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe minde is ſtayed on thee, Iſai.</hi> 26. 3. Now Gods Elect, after they are effectually called, are wont to have their mindes thus ſtayed on him. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. They that are wont to truſt in God really, and in ſincerity, here in this world, ſhal have perfect peace in the world to come; as the Prophet adds in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place; <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he truſteth in thee, Iſai.</hi> 26. 3. Now Gods Elect, after their effectual calling, are wont thus to truſt in him. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. They that do or ſhall love Gods Word in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:93010:139"/> while they live here, ſhall have perfect peace in the world to come, becauſe they ſhall have great peace in this life; as it is written, <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Law, Pſal.</hi> 119. 165. Now <hi>Gods</hi> Elect are ſuch as do or ſhall love his Word in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, while they live here. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7.

Now Gods Elect are ſuch as do or ſhall endevor to walk according to this rule, whiles they live in this world. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="10">10. They that shall have nothing to offend them in the world to come, shall have perfect peace in that world: But Gods Elect shall have nothing to offend them in the world to come; as it is promiſed in plain words, <hi>Nothing ſhall offend them, Pſal.</hi> 119. 165.

               <p>Firſt, It makes for the confutation of ſuch, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a ſtate of perfect peace in this world before its end; and give out in their <hi>Pamphlets, That the latter times ſhall abound with ſuch peace and unity, as the like was never ſeen:</hi> For proof whereof they wreſt many paſſages of Scripture, and draw them to a wrong ſence. But theſe Writers are much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken: For (as I have ſhewed before) that perfect peace, which is promiſed in <hi>holy Writ,</hi> belongs to the world to come, not to this world. And it is a vain thing for any to expect perfect peace in this world, for theſe cauſes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>God hath put enmity betwixt the ſeed of the woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent, Gen.</hi> 3. betwixt the godly and the wicked: ſo that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are ſtill an abomination to the juſt, and the juſt are ſtill an abomination to the wicked: Which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity doubtleſs will continue as long as this world it ſelf continues.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:93010:140"/> 2. Becauſe there is ſtill an enmity betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit in every regenerate perſon: <hi>For the fleſh lusteth against the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other: ſo that we cannot do the things that we would, Gal.</hi> 5. 17. Which enmity alſo is likely to continue unto the worlds end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes this <hi>latter age of the world,</hi> fore-shews, <hi>that the latter times ſhall be very unquiet, troubleſom, and perillous.</hi> What ſaith our Saviour? <hi>Think not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I am come to ſend peace on Earth: I came not to ſend peace, but a ſword. I am come to ſet a man at variance againſt his father, and the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against her mother, and the daughter in law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her mother in law; and a mans foes ſhall be they of his own houſhold, Matt.</hi> 10. 24, 35, 36. <hi>And ye ſhall hear of wars, and rumors of wars, Matth.</hi> 24. 6. <hi>And,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the world ye ſhall have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, Joh.</hi> 16. 33. <hi>In the last days perillous times ſhall come,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. Yea, we finde, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. <hi>That Chriſt at his ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Heaven ſhall find the Nations of the world in a poſture of war:</hi> And for theſe Reaſons we have no cauſe to think, that the <hi>latter times</hi> shall be ſuch <hi>peaceable times,</hi> as ſome have deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Indeed, I grant, That <hi>Gods faithful people</hi> and <hi>ſervants,</hi> at certain times, may enjoy much good peace in <hi>this world;</hi> They may have ſome experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of peace with God through Chriſt; They may have, at times, ſome peace of Conſcience within themſelves; They may have peace from war, and peace from publick perſecution, for a time: But for any to dream of <hi>perfect peace in this world,</hi> is all one
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:93010:141"/> as to dream of a dry Summer, when Winter is at hand. Wherefore let us not harken unto thoſe that preach and promiſe <hi>peace, peace,</hi> when <hi>trouble</hi> is neer.</p>
               <p>Again, It may inform us, That <hi>Gods Elect</hi> should not be too much diſcouraged or dejected by reaſon of <hi>their tribulations and want of peace in this life:</hi> For ſuch is the condition of this world, <hi>many are the troubles of the righteous;</hi> and all that will live godly in Chriſt, muſt ſuffer here what is appointed for them: Yea, they may ſeek and pray for outward peace with men, and yet not finde it; They may ſeek and pray for inward peace of Conſcience, and yet not obtain ſo much of it as they deſire. But in the World to come they shall have as much peace, both inward and outward, as their hearts can deſire, and that for ever: which will be a ſufficient recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for <hi>their want of peace in this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, If we deſire to have <hi>perfect peace in the World to come with Gods Elect,</hi> then we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devor to perform all ſuch conditions, on our part, as have the promiſe of this peace annexed to them: that is to ſay;</p>
               <p>We muſt endevor <hi>to be reconciled to God through Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt endevor <hi>to be really justified and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>We muſt endevor <hi>to have our mindes ſtayed on God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt endevor <hi>to truſt in him effectually.</hi>

               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:93010:141"/>
               <p> We muſt endeavour <hi>to be upright before him.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>We muſt endeavour <hi>to do that which is good in his ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For theſe are the Conditions which have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of this peace annexed to them: and if we make conſcience of performing them, we ſhall not miſs of <hi>perfect and everlasting peace</hi> in the World to come.</p>
               <p>The other Propoſition is, <hi>That Reprobates</hi>

               <p>Which <hi>Tribulation</hi> of theirs, as I conceive, ſhall be a total privation of peace in that World: For they ſhall have no peace with God, no peace with Chriſt, no peace with their Conſciences, no peace with the Saints, no peace from among the Angels, no peace from among themſelves, in that World: Which <hi>total want of Peace</hi> will be unto them <hi>a great and perfect Tribulation,</hi> and that <hi>Tribulation</hi> which is mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>that Reprobates ſhall have no peace at all in the world to come,</hi> may be proved by theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments enſuing:</p>
               <p n="1">1. They that ſhall be <hi>ſtrangers from Chriſt</hi> in the World to come, ſhall have no peace at all in that world, the peace of that world being <hi>Chriſts pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe:</hi>

               <p n="2">2. They that ſhall be found <hi>unrighteous perſons</hi> in the World to come, ſhall have no peace at all
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:93010:142"/> in that world: But Reprobates ſhall be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous perſons in the world to come: <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They that ſhall be found unclean and filthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the world to come, ſhall have no peace at all in that world: But Reprobates ſhall be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and filthy perſons in the world to come; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of Saint <hi>John, He that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill, Rev.</hi> 22. 11. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They that ſhall be found <hi>impenitent ſinners</hi> in the World to come, ſhall have no peace at all in that world; as we may gather from that of Saint <hi>Paul, Tribulation and anguiſh ſhall be upon every Soul of man that doth evil, of the Jews firſt, and alſo of the Greek, Rom.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>viz.</hi> if they ſhall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally perſiſt in doing evil without repentance. Now <hi>Reprobates</hi> ſhall be found <hi>impenitent perſons</hi> in the world to come. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. They that ſhall be found <hi>wicked perſons</hi> in the world to come, ſhall have no peace at all in that world; as it is written, <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked, Iſai.</hi> 57. 21. But <hi>Reprobates</hi> ſhall be found <hi>wicked perſons</hi> in the world to come. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. They that will never know <hi>the way of peace,</hi> while they live in this world, ſhall have no peace at all in that which is to come: But <hi>Reprobates</hi> will never know <hi>the way of peace,</hi> while they live in this world, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59. 8. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>paths,</hi> while they live in this world. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. They that will ſtill be <hi>Enemies to a godly peace</hi> in this world, ſhall have no peace at all in that which is to come: But <hi>Reprobates</hi> will ſtill be <hi>Enemies to a godly Peace</hi> in this world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121. 6, 7. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They ſhall have no peace at all in that which is to come, but tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this their Tribulation ſhall be a total privation, or want of peace, as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Which Propoſition doth not onely confirm what hath been formerly affirmed, <hi>viz. That it had</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>been good for Reprobates if they had never been born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But alſo ſhews, <hi>That ſuch ſhall gain nothing at the last by any Peace of theirs in this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, if there be any Civil or National Peace here, Reprobates may have a ſhare in it, as well as others: If there be any peace in ſinning, they are wont to have the greateſt ſhare in it. But what ſhall it profit them, when at laſt <hi>their peace</hi> ſhall end in <hi>tribulation?</hi> Surely nothing; Rather then they ſhall wiſh they had never known any ſuch peace.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if we will provide for our own ſafety, that we may be preſerved from <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> in the World to come, we muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, while we live here, to ſhun and decline <hi>thoſe crooked paths of unrighteouſneſs, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, impenitency, hatred of godly peace, &amp;c.</hi> which are wont to bring men at the laſt to <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Tribulation:</hi> And if we be careful thus to do, then we ſhall never know, by experience

               </p>
               <p>The former Propoſition is, <hi>That Gods Elect</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Propoſit.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>ſhall abound with ſpiritual Light in the World to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſpeak not here of <hi>that natural and bodily Light</hi> which ſhall be ſuitable to <hi>their new natures</hi> in the World to come, of which doubtleſs they ſhall finde no want; but onely of <hi>their ſpiritual Light</hi> in that World, which ſhall far ſurpaſs <hi>that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Light</hi> which the <hi>best Christians</hi> have in this world.</p>
               <p>For I grant, That the <hi>regenerate</hi> have ſome <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Light</hi> in this world: for which cauſe they are called <hi>the children of Light, Luk.</hi> 16. 8. That is to ſay:</p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:93010:143"/>
               <p> They have ſome <hi>light of ſaving knowledg,</hi> which is a ſpiritual kinde of Light, and that which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>The people which ſate in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſaw great light; and to them which ſate in the region and ſhadow of death, light is ſprung up:</hi> viz. <hi>the light of ſaving knowledg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have ſome <hi>Light of Holineſs,</hi> which is a ſpiritual kinde of Light too, and that which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your Father in Heaven.</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the upright there ariſeth light in darkneſs.</hi> But all this <hi>ſpiritual light</hi> of theirs is but little, in compariſon of that which Gods Elect ſhall have in the World to come; becauſe therein <hi>they ſhall abound with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Light:</hi> that is, they ſhall have as much <hi>light of ſaving knowledg,</hi> as much <hi>light of holineſs,</hi> as much <hi>light of godly experience,</hi> in that world, as their hearts ſhall be able to wiſh and deſire to have.</p>
               <p>For proof whereof, theſe following Arguments are to be conſidered:</p>
               <p n="1">1. They that have <hi>ſpiritual Light ſown already for them,</hi> shall have abundance thereof, and abound therewith in the world to come.

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:93010:144"/> And when he ſaith, <hi>that this light is ſown for them,</hi> his meaning is, that God hath certainly decreed and intended to give them a ful and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meaſure of this Light in the next VVorld, as men do certainly intend a ful crop for the poor, when they ſow plentifully for them. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

               <p>And to ſtrengthen this probability, I refer the Reader to theſe three places of Scripture; firſt it is ſaid of Reprobates <hi>that they ſhall ſee Abraham and Iſaac and Iacob, and all the Prophets in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, Luke</hi> 13. 28. and ſhal they not ſee them ſo as to know them? yes; Secondly, it is ſaid in the Parable of <hi>Dives, that he ſaw Abraham a</hi>

                  <hi>far off and Lazarus in his boſome,</hi> and did he not ſee them ſo as to know them? yes; and if Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates ſhal have ſuch knowledge of the Saints in the next VVorld, as ſhal yeeld them no comfort at al: doubtleſſe Gods Elect ſhal have ſuch knowledge one of another, as wil be ful of comfort. Thirdly, when Chriſt was transfigured upon the Mount in the preſence of <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> it is ſaid that there appeared unto them <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and talked with him, and they appeared in ſuch a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſhape that <hi>Peter</hi> knew them diſtinctly, and thereupon ſaid, <hi>Maſter it is good for us to be here, if thou wilt, let us make here three Tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moſes and one for Elias,</hi> Mat. 17. 3, 4. Which transfiguration of Chriſt with its occurrences I conceive to be a lively repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what ſhal be in the VVorld to come. And
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93010:146"/> ſo its probable from hence alſo what mutual and comfortable knowledge the Saints ſhal have one of another in that VVorld? and conſequently that they ſhal abound with <hi>spirituall light</hi> in it.</p>

               <p>Which Propoſition thus proved, may be uſeful, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> as, firſt it makes for the confutation of ſuch, as in theſe dayes are wont to boaſt much of <hi>new lights</hi> received, and give out, that the latter times shal generaly abound with <hi>ſpirituall light</hi> more then the former; that the ordinary ſort of Saints shal shortly have as much <hi>ſpirituall light</hi> as the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have, if not more, and ſo shal have no need of publik Paſtors and Teachers to inſtruct them; yea, that fulneſs of <hi>ſpirituall light,</hi> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the VVorld, they apply unto the Latter Times.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93010:146"/>
               <p> Now in al this they do but delude themſelves, and the VVorld, as may be ſeen in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas they boaſt of <hi>new lights</hi> received, in this they doe but juggle and put Light for darkneſs: for it is wel known that their darkeſt errors are ſhrouded under this Notion of <hi>new lights,</hi> and though they varnish them what they can with a ſemblance of Light: yet that Light which ſeemes to to be in them is but <hi>spirituall darkneſſe,</hi> and if ſo, how great is that darkneſs?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas they ſay, that the Latter Times shal generaly abound with <hi>ſpirituall light</hi> more then the former: in this there can be no truth, becauſe the new Teſtament shews that the Latter Times shal generaly abound with Atheiſme, Error and Iniquity more then the former. Now Atheiſme, Error and Iniquity are ſo many branches of <hi>ſpirituall darkneſs,</hi> and if the Latter Times shal generaly abound with <hi>spirituall darkneſſe</hi> more then the former; how can they generaly abound with <hi>ſpirituall light</hi> more then the former? Indeed I conceive that ſome particular truths relating to the VVorld to come, shal be more plainely diſcovered towards the end of this VVorld by ordinary Teachers; then formerly they have been by ſuch Teachers, and in this ſenſe, knowledge may be increaſed about the time of the end, as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 4. yet we may not infer from hence that the Latter Times, shal generaly abound with <hi>spirituall light</hi> more then the former.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas they ſay, that the ordinary ſort of Saints shal shortly have as much <hi>ſpirituall light</hi> as the Apoſtles themſelves had, if not more; there can be no truth in this neither; becauſe the Apoſtles
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:93010:147"/> were taught of God immediately in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, whereas the ordinary ſort of Saints are now taught of him but mediately, in an ordinary way and it is againſt reaſon to think that this latter way of teaching ſhould produce more ſpiritual light the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the former, or as much: But the truth is, that in the Apoſtles Writings are many things ſo hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that many ordinary Saints at this day, with all their ſpiritual light, cannot attain to the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas they ſay, That the Saints of latter times ſhall have no need of Paſtors and Teachers for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them: This is point blank againſt our Saviors doctrine and practiſe: for he hath not only ordained that publike Paſtors and Teachers ſhall be continued in the Church to the end of the world, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 13. but alſo hath promiſed to be with them unto the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whereas they ſay, That the fulneſs of ſpiritual light promiſed in the Word is to be exhibited in the latter times; this is a meer deluſion too: for it may appear by that which hath been formerly ſaid, That the fulneſs of ſpiritual light promiſed apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the World to come, and not to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world. Wherefore we ſhould not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to ſuch as ſpeak and boaſt ſo much of new Lights.</p>
               <p>Again, It may inform us, That the World to come is much to be deſired of all good Chriſtians: as in other reſpects, ſo in reſpect of that ſpiritual light which ſhall abound in it: This world we know is much deſired of ſome, in reſpect of that natural and bodily light which may be enjoyed in it; for truly the light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for the
<pb facs="tcp:93010:147"/> yes to behold the Sun, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 7. And it is much deſired of others, in reſpect of that ſpiritual light which may be enjoyed in it. Now Gods Elect ſhal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>oy much more ſpiritual light in the World to come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen may be expected in this life: for whiles they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ive here, they are defective in their ſpiritual light of ſaving knowledg, in their ſpiritual light of holineſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n their ſpiritual light of experience; but in that world they ſhall know no ſuch defect: whiles they live here, the beſt of them <hi>know but in part, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy in part,</hi> and <hi>ſee as through a glaſs, darkly;</hi> but in the World to come they <hi>ſhall know as they are known,</hi> and <hi>ſhall ſee face to face,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. Wherefore that world is much to be deſired in this reſpect.</p>
               <p>And if any deſire it in this reſpect, there are three Things eſpecially expected from them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they be ſoundly regenerated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that ſo they may be tranſlated into a ſtate of ſpiritual light.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That after this, they be thankful for the ſpiritual light which they have received, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16. 7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they be careful to improve their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al light, ſo as to walk in it, or according to it, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>The other Propoſition is, <hi>That Reprobates ſhall be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Propoſit.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>puniſhed with ſpiritual darkneſs in the World to come.</hi> Some perhaps may think that Reprobates ſhall be puniſhed with bodily darkneſs in the next world; as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were in <hi>Moſes</hi> time; for then <hi>God</hi> brought a <hi>thick</hi> &amp; palpable <hi>darknes over al the land of Egypt, ſo that the Egyptians could not ſee one</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:93010:148"/> 
                  <hi>another, nor riſe any one off his place for three days, Exod.</hi> 10. 23. yet I cannot think ſo; for if they ſhall be puniſhed with bodily darkneſs, how then can it be that they <hi>ſhall ſee him whom they have pierced?</hi> how then can it be that they ſhall ſee <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaac and Iacob in the Kingdom of God?</hi> which things they ſhall certainly ſee with their bodily eyes in that world: rather then I think that their bodily eyes ſhall be clear enough; but their ſpiritual eyes ſhall be darkened, and they covered with ſpiritual darkneſs in that world. Which ſpiritual darkneſs of theirs, as I conceive, ſhall be a total and perpetual privation of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual light which belongs to Gods Elect in that world; that is to ſay, they ſhall have no light of ſaving knowledg, no light of holineſs, no light of comfortable experience in that world; but the darkneſs of ignorance, the darkneſs of an unholy life, the darkneſs of diſcomfort, being ſo many branches of ſpiritual darkneſs ſhall ſtill remain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. And this darkneſs of theirs is called in Scripture <hi>the midſt of darkneſs;</hi> it may be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall not know how to come forth of it: Its called <hi>the blackneſs of darkneſs;</hi> it may be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall have no comfort in it: It is called <hi>outer darkneſs;</hi> it may be, becauſe it ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to an outer ſort of people, ſuch as ſhall be found to be out of Chriſt, and out of Gods favour in that world.</p>
               <p>Now that Reprobates ſhall be puniſhed with <hi>ſpiritual darkneſs</hi> in the World to come, may thus be proved:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is ſaid, That <hi>the light of the wicked ſhall be put out, Job</hi> 18. 5. where, as I ſuppoſe, the Text
<pb facs="tcp:93010:148"/> ſpeaks not of bodily light; for in this ſence it may be as truly ſaid, <hi>The light of the godly ſhall be put out,</hi> as <hi>the light of the wicked ſhall be put out:</hi> but it ſpeaks of that <hi>ſpiritual light</hi> which wicked hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites may ſeem to have in this life, and ſo the meaning is, That that <hi>ſpiritual light</hi> which wicked hypocrites may ſeem to have in this life (if they ſhall ſtill remain ſuch, and be found Reprobates at the laſt) ſhall be one day altogether extinguiſhed, and put out: from whence I may argue thus; <hi>They that ſhall have their ſeeming ſpiritual light altogether extinguiſhed, and put out, ſhall be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſpiritual darkneſs in the World to come:</hi> But Reprobates ſhall have their ſeeming <hi>ſpiritual light</hi> altogether extinguiſhed, and put out. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They that have no ſpiritual light ſown for them, ſhall be puniſhed with ſpiritual darkneſs in the World to come: Now Reprobates have no ſpiritual light ſown for them; as may be gathered from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 11. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They that will ſtill be the children of Satans Kingdom in this world, ſhall be puniſhed with ſpiritual darkneſs in that which is to come; as it is written, <hi>The children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt out into outer darkneſs, Mat.</hi> 8. 12. Now Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates will ſtill be the children of Satans Kingdom in this world. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

               <p n="4">4.

                  </label> it cannot be ſafe for any to remain ſtill in the ſtate of nature and unregeneracy; becauſe all unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſons, as long as they remain ſuch, are in a ſtate of ſpiritual darkneſs, <hi>being alienated from the life of God, through the darkneſs that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their hearts, Epheſ.</hi> 4 18. being deſtitute of all ſaving knowledg of God, of Chriſt, and divine Myſteries; and being deſtitute of all real holineſs, and godly experience.

               <p>Which Propoſition, thus proved, may be uſeful <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> thus:</p>
               <p>Firſt, It makes for the confutation of ſuch as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a time of much joy, if not perfect joy, for <hi>Gods faithful people</hi> here in this world, before the end; and ſay, <hi>That the Sword, which is now drawn, ſhall ſubdue all the open Enemies of Gods people; and ſo all tears ſhall be wiped from their eyes, and their hearts ſhall be filled with joy unspeakable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all this is againſt the Word of God point-blank.</p>
               <p>For, 1. the Word ſhews, <hi>That the latter times ſhall be perillous times for Gods faithful people,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. And if they ſhall be <hi>perillous times</hi> for them, how can they be ſuch joyful times for them, as theſe men ſpeak of?</p>
               <p>2. Our Saviour, ſpeaking of the wars and tumults of the <hi>latter times,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That all theſe are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of ſorrows, Mat.</hi> 24. 8. And if the wars of the <hi>latter times</hi> ſhall be <hi>the beginning of ſorrows,</hi> how can they be <hi>occaſions of ſo much joy</hi> as theſe ſpeak of?</p>
               <p>3. The Word ſhews, <hi>That the wars of the latter times ſhall be increaſed about the time of Christs ſecond Coming, Rev.</hi> 20. 9. And if ſo, how can or
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:93010:152"/> ſhall they produce <hi>ſuch joyful times</hi> in this world, as theſe men expect.</p>
               <p>4. I have shewed before, That <hi>that fulneſs of joy and gladneſs,</hi> which is promiſed in the Word of God, appertains not to this world, but to that which is to come.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we should not harken to theſe filthy Dreamers, becauſe we finde by experience that their Dreams are deceitful: For while they dream of <hi>much light,</hi> behold <hi>much darkneſs</hi> that may be felt; and while they dream of <hi>much joy,</hi> behold <hi>much ſorrow and vexation of ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It may inform us, <hi>That Gods Elect ſhall be well rewarded at the laſt, for all their godly ſorrow in this life.</hi> Indeed, whiles they live here, they are wont to be in heavineſs through manifold temptations: Whiles they live here, they are wont to mourn much after a godly ſort for their own ſins, for the ſins of others, for the afflictions and ſufferings of Chriſt, for the afflictions of their brethren, and for all the fruits and effects of Gods diſpleaſure: But in the World to come all this ſorrow of theirs shall be turned into gladneſs: They shall have <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for aſhes, the oyl of joy for mourning, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs, Iſaiah</hi> 61. 3. And as this ſorrow of theirs shall more or leſs abound in this world, ſo shall their godly Joy more or leſs abound in that which is to come: which will be a ſufficient recompence for all their good ſorrow; and is ſtill promiſed as a recompence thereof in divers places before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if we deſire to abound with joy in that world which is to come, we muſt be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whiles we live here, to ſow in tears of godly
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:93010:152"/> ſorrow: and if we ſow plentifully in this way, we shall reap plentifully; according to Gods promiſe, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>He that goeth forth, and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, bearing precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſs come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with rejoycing, bringing his ſheaves with him, Pſal.</hi> 126. 6.</p>
               <p>The other Propoſition is, <hi>That Reprobates ſhall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Propoſit.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>abound with ſorow in the world to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which <hi>ſorrow</hi> of theirs, though it shall be ſuch as no mortal man can fully conceive and expreſs; yet others have expreſſed what they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived touching the ſame: And why may not I do the like?</p>
               <p>I conceive then; Firſt, That <hi>the ſorrow of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates</hi> in the World to come, shall be, not onely a privation of all thoſe joys which belong to Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in that world; but alſo shall be a poſitive and real paſſion of grief and vexation. Secondly, I conceive, That in the next world they shall mourn, not onely for the guilt of all thoſe ſins, which shall be then and there layd to their charge; but alſo for all thoſe pains, torments, and punishments, which shall be then and there inflicted on them. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I conceive, That this <hi>mourning of theirs</hi> shall be expreſſed by <hi>ſighs and groans,</hi> by <hi>ſobs and tears,</hi> by <hi>weeping and howling,</hi> by <hi>grinding and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>that Reprobates ſhall abound with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the WORLD to come,</hi> may be thus proved:</p>
               <p n="1">1. They that ſhal expreſs their grief in the world to come by <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> shall abound with ſorrow in that world: Now <hi>Reprobates</hi> shall expreſs their grief in the next world by <hi>weeping and</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They that ſhall <hi>cry for ſorrow of heart, and howl for vexation of ſpirit</hi> in the world to come, ſhall abound with ſorrow in that world: But <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates ſhall cry for ſorrow of heart, and howl for vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſpirit</hi> in the world to come, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 75. 14. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They that will ſtill <hi>contemn the ſpirit and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of godly ſorrow,</hi> whiles they live in this world, <hi>and chooſe rather to ſpend their time in carnal mirth and jollity,</hi> ſhall abound with ſorrow in that which is to come; according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Wo unto you that laugh now, for ye ſhall mourn and weep, Luk.</hi> 6. 25.

               </p>

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:93010:156"/> themſelves and others, abundance of holy and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſecurity in this Life, and ſay, <hi>that the Saints in the latter times ſhall have ſo much reſt and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, that none ſhall be able to make them affraid, neither ſhall they fear any evill, preſent or to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe are much miſtaken for it hath been ſhewed before <hi>that the bleſſing of perfect ſecurity is not to be enjoyed in this world, but only in that which is to come.</hi> And how can we expect ſuch a bleſſing in this World, ſeeing it is well known that as long as we live here, we are ſtil under a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſinning and under a poſſibility of ſuffering for ſin? and can we be free or ſafe from the fear of evil as long as we are in ſuch a condition? ſurely no, becauſe every known act of ſin begets in men the fear of puniſhment, and every puniſhment for ſin, begets the fear of another puniſhment, away then with this conceit.</p>
               <p>Againe, if Gods Elect ſhal dwel ſecurely from al fear of evil in the VVorld to come, then this may informe us that it is a great favour and mercy of God for any to be of the number of his Elect; and no marvel that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was thankful to God for the election of ſome amongſt the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and for the election of ſome amongſt the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> for he knew this election of theirs to be a great grace and favour of God, wherefore they that have a ſhare in this grace, can never be ſufficiently thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for it, conſidering that by vertue of it they ſhal enjoy many priviledges in the VVorld to come, and this of perfect and happy ſecurity amongſt the reſt.

               <p>Thirdly, if we deſire to partake of this bleſſing in the World to come, we muſt endeavour whiles we live here to performe ſuch conditions, as have the promiſe of perfect and happy ſecurity annexed to them, that is to ſay;</p>

               <p>The other Propoſition is, <hi>that Reprobates ſhal</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Propo.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>be afraid in the World to come:</hi> that is, They ſhall be perplexed with the feare of evil in that World, they ſhal ſtil fear the diſpleaſure of God, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of Chriſt, the diſpleaſure of the Saints with a ſlaviſh fear, they ſhal ſtil fear the Paines, Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Torments, which are to be ſuffered by them in that World, and that with a perplexed feare.</p>
               <p>And for proof hereof, theſe Arguments may be produced.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the perplexed feare of evil be a <hi>spirituall puniſhment</hi> belonging unto Reprobates in this VVorld, then they ſhall have much more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it in that which is to come.</p>
               <p>Now the perplexed fear of evill is a <hi>spirituall</hi>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:93010:157"/> 
                  <hi>puniſhment</hi> belonging unto ſuch in this world, as may appeare by theſe paſſages. <hi>The ſtrangers shall fade away and be afraid out of their cloſe places, Pſal.</hi> 18. 45. <hi>They ſhall be afraid; pangs and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſhall take hold of them: they ſhall be in paine as a Woman that travelleth, they ſhall be amazed one at another, their faces ſhall be as flames, Iſa.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>in that day ſhall Egypt be like unto Women, it ſhall be afraid and fear, becauſe of the ſhaking of the hand of the Lord of Hosts, which he ſhaketh over it. Eſay.</hi> 19. 16. <hi>The ſinners in Zion are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid fearfulneſſe hath ſurpriſed the Hypocrites: who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire: Eſay</hi> 33. 14. from all which places we may gather that the perplexed fear of evil is a <hi>spirituall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> belonging unto <hi>Reprobates</hi> in this world, and if ſo, how can they eſcape the full meaſure of it in that which is to come? ſeeing ſpiritual puniſhments in this life are but the firſt fruits of a full crop to be received hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They that ſhall be afraid of <hi>the laſt judgement,</hi> ſhal be perplexed with the fear of evill in the world to come. Now Reprobates ſhall be afraid of the <hi>laſt judgement, for they ſhall hide themſelves in the dens and Rock of the Mountaines, and ſhall ſay unto the Mountaines and Rocks fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to ſtand? Rev.</hi> 15. 16, 17. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. They that ſhall have <hi>vexing and accuſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi> in the World to come, shall be perplexed with the fear of evill in that World; but <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates</hi> shall have <hi>vexing and accuſing Conſciences</hi>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:93010:157"/> in the world to come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They that ſhall ſuffer <hi>Helliſh torments</hi> in the world to come, ſhall be perplexed with the fear of evil in that world: But <hi>Reprobates</hi> shall ſuffer <hi>hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh torments</hi> in the world to come, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 9. 17. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this latter Propoſition may be applied thus: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, It confirms that divine Maxim, which hath been often repeated, <hi>viz. That it had been good for Reprobates if they had never been born: For if they had never been born, they could never have had any experience of ſuch perplexed fears, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come:</hi> But now ſeeing they have been, are, or shall be born, they cannot avoyd them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may inform us, <hi>That it ſhall be worſe with them in the world to come, in respect of this fear, then it can be with them in this life:</hi> For though, whiles they live here, they may tremble, fear, and be much aſtoniſhed, by reaſon of Gods Judgments; yet hereafter they ſhall be much more aſtoniſhed in this reſpect.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It ſhould admoniſh all, whiles we live here, to provide for our own ſafety, that we may dwell ſecurely, and may be free from fear of evil, in the world to come. And for this end,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt ſtill <hi>pray for the bleſſing of pardon and reconcilion;</hi> which bleſſing, if we can obtain before our death, we ſhall be ſafe from the fear of evil in the next world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt ſtill <hi>pray for the bleſſing of inward peace, and aſſurance of conſcience;</hi> which if we can obtain before our death, we ſhall be ſafe from the of evil in the next world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt ſtill <hi>pray for the ſpirit of Adoption;</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:93010:158"/> which if we can obtain before our death, we ſhall be ſafe from the fear of evil in the next world, and ſhall be able to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>We have not received the ſpirit of bondage to fear again; but we have received the ſpirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father, Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We muſt ſtill <hi>pray for the ſpirit of Love, that it may increaſe and abound more and more in us;</hi> which if we can obtain before our death, then we ſhall be perfect in love hereafter in the next world; and this perfect love will caſt out all ſlaviſh fear of evil, and make us dwell ſecurely for ever.</p>
               <p>Finally, By all that hath been ſaid, touching the different condition of Gods Elect and Reprobates in the world to come, we may plainly perceive the error of ſuch as plead for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Redemption,</hi> and ſay, <hi>That Chriſt by his Death hath purchaſed Eternal Redemption for all and every one of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, none of them excepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch bold aſſertion muſt needs be erroneous; becauſe it croſſeth all ſuch Scripture paſſages, as do by way of <hi>Antitheſis</hi> deſcribe a different condition of Mankinde in the world to come. And if there shall be ſuch and ſo many differences betwixt men and men in the world to come, as have been before diſcovered, how can all and every one of them agree, or be equal, in the grace of Redemption? Or, if all men agree, and be equal in the grace of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how can there be ſuch differences betwixt them in the world to come? Doubtleſs there shall be no oppoſitive differences betwixt the redeemed of the Lord in the next world: But all ſuch differences shal be betwixt the redeemed, and the not redeemed.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I may ſafely ſay, That the grace of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:93010:158"/> Redemption is the priviledg of Gods Elect, and was purchaſed onely for them, not for all and every one of Mankinde: And our Saviour plainly intimated ſo much, when he ſaid, <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep, Joh.</hi> 10. 15. And leſt any should think that by <hi>ſheep</hi> in this place we are to underſtand <hi>all and every one of Mankinde,</hi> he doth elſewhere di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguish between <hi>ſheep</hi> and <hi>goats, Matth.</hi> 25. that we may underſtand by <hi>ſheep</hi> the whole company of <hi>Gods Elect,</hi> and by <hi>goats,</hi> the whole company of <hi>Reprobates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though the Scripture ſaith in ſome places, <hi>That Christ dyed for all, and taſted Death for all,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. yet we muſt know, that in theſe, and ſuch like places, the word <hi>All</hi> is not taken abſolutely, for all without exception; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictively, for all the <hi>Elect,</hi> or for ſome of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and all conditions: And in this ſence the word <hi>All</hi> doth but ſignifie <hi>many</hi> in the Doctrine of Mans Redemption: for which cauſe it is often expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture by the word <hi>many;</hi> as when it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt gave his life a ranſom for many, Mat.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>He ſhed his blood for many, Matth.</hi> 26. 28. <hi>He was once offered, to bear the ſins of many, Hebr.</hi> 9. 28.</p>
               <p>Away then with the Doctrine of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:</hi> It hath been too long preached by ſome, and by ſuch as know not how to content themſelves and the people longer then they are harping upon this ſtring. But methinks the different condition of Mankinde, of Elect and Reprobates, in the world to come, should make them aſhamed to own this Doctrine any longer; becauſe it is not poſſible for them to reconcile this Doctrine of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:93010:159"/> with the Doctrine of the World to come: For the former Doctrine communicates the benefit of Chriſts Death unto all and every one of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde; but the latter denies it unto many, yea, unto all the Reprobate ſort of Mankinde: And ſo, for the preſent, I conclude this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord give you underſtanding in all things needful for you to know.</hi>
